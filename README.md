# OCR-to-Hash Claim Verification System

![Jest and Playwright tests, then deploy to GitHub Pages](https://github.com/paul-hammant/verific/actions/workflows/deploy.yml/badge.svg)

**Proof of concept** implementing the approach described in:
[OCR-to-Hash: A Simple Audit Trail for Physical Documents](https://paulhammant.com/2023/01/17/ocr-to-hash-simple-audit-trail-for-physical-documents/).
For now this is using Tesseract for OCR, and OpenCV for registration marker detection and de-skew for imperfect holding of the camera. iOS's **Live Text** feature (Camera app, iOS 15+) already has the core OCR capability - it just needs a few enhancements to recognize `verify:` URLs, normalize text, and compute hashes on-device. The technology is much closer to mainstream adoption than it might appear.

**⚠️ Project Status:** Incomplete because of imperfect OCR. I've a bug in Tesseract.js (actually two different alternates to Tesseract C++ made 
available for web/JavasScript via WASM) that is not in the most recent C++ version. [See proof](https://github.com/paul-hammant/verific/issues/1). 
Likely a jump to native Tesseract could fix the bug I list, and more. That reduces the ease of deployment/upgrades which is a factor for a solo
developer without funding. So for now, broken OCR tests are checked in.

## The Problem

**Claims to the authenticity of various printed or pictures of things are hard to verity:** One example that has a billion+ incidents a day is 
a **sales receipt** with an implicit **claim** that is genuine rather than fake. Here is one from wikimedia: 

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0b/ReceiptSwiss.jpg/250px-ReceiptSwiss.jpg). 

Is that real, or generated by [MakeReceipt.com](https://makereceipt.com/create-receipt1.php) and others. 

So expense fraud is a real thing, and verifying printed/scanned claims (like sales receipts, but there are many more) needs disruption:

- **❌ Calling organizations** - Slow, manual, business hours only, privacy-invasive
- **❌ Uploading to verification portals** - Cloud storage, data breach risk, vendor lock-in
- **❌ QR codes** - Hide what they verify, visual clutter, privacy-destroying (encoded data or public registries)
- **❌ Have to user cloud services** - Send your PII to third vendors who you're forced to trust have impregnable systems and are above board.
- **❌ Fake credentials** - Forged degrees, photoshopped receipts, counterfeit certifications cost billions annually

**Specific pain points:**
- **Employers:** Can't verify degrees without calling universities during business hours
- **Finance teams:** Can't detect photoshopped receipts reused across multiple expense reports
- **Hospitals:** Can't instantly verify medical licenses at point of care
- **Customs agents:** Can't verify product safety certifications from foreign suppliers (see MedPro fraud case)

## The Solution

**Example:** Four colleagues have lunch at In-N-Out Burger. One person pays, scans the receipt with their phone to verify it's authentic (not photoshopped, not altered), then submits it for expense reimbursement. Later, their company's expense system asks: *"Who attended? What percentage is billable to client projects? What percentage is reimbursable vs. company-paid?"* None of that detail concerns In-N-Out Burger - they just confirm: *"Yes, this receipt is authentic. Transaction occurred at this time, this amount, this location."* The receipt's SHA-256 hash has been verified. The company handles attribution, allocation, and approval internally.

See that "verify:" line ... we'll come back to that.

**This is OCR-to-hash verification:** A **100% client-side** web app that uses phone camera OCR to verify printed claims via SHA-256 hash validation against URLs printed on the documents themselves.

**Key benefits:**
- ✅ **Instant verification** - Seconds, not phone calls or portal uploads
- ✅ **Privacy-preserving** - Images never leave your phone, only hash is sent
- ✅ **Works offline** - OCR happens on-device, only hash lookup needs network
- ✅ **One app for everything** - Degrees, receipts, licenses, certificates, government IDs
- ✅ **Tamper-evident** - Any alteration changes the hash, verification fails
- ✅ **No cloud OCR** - No Google/AWS/Azure seeing your personal documents

## Quick Start

**Try it now:**
1. Visit **[https://paul-hammant.github.io/verific/](https://paul-hammant.github.io/verific/)** on your phone
2. Click "Start Camera"
3. Print a [training page](public/training-pages/bachelor-thaumatology.html) for the app to snap (or display the same on your computer screen).
4. Align the black registration marks in your phone's viewfinder
5. Click "Capture & Verify"
6. See ✅ **VERIFIED by paul-hammant.github.io** or ❌ **FAILS VERIFICATION**

Note: no serious production verification deployment of this technology would rest on `github.io`. I am only doing so 
because I am demonstrating how this works and GH-P is convenient, free, and static (proving the server-side can be almost absent) 
You'd see "VERIFIED BY bankofamerica.com' and alike for real prod deployments.

## What is a Claim?

A **claim** is any assertion that could be forged, altered, or reused fraudulently:

- **Till receipts** - Transaction occurred (could be photoshopped for duplicate expense claims)
- **Degree certificates** - Qualification earned (diploma mills, fake credentials cost employers millions)
- **Employment letters** - Work history (easily forged for background checks)
- **Safety certifications** - Product compliance (supplier fraud - billions in counterfeit certs)
- **Medical licenses** - Authorization to practice (or revocation - critical for patient safety)
- **Government IDs** - Identity verification (fake IDs for fraud, underage access)

Many more use cases documented below.

## How It Works

Is the "verify:" line in the receipt that is the clue to OCR that verification can happen:

Another day, we'll see if we can't get this working without a black border.

**Variable element:** Each verifiable document needs something unique - a date/time, person's name, serial number, transaction ID, or other changing value. This ensures each certificate has a unique hash and prevents reuse of the same verification across different claims or brute force guessing of valid hashes.

**Multi-page documents:** Documents like bank statements, contracts, wills, and multi-page reports can include a `verify:` line on **each page**. Each page gets its own hash verification. This allows:
- **Page-level verification:** Verify individual pages without needing the entire document
- **Tamper detection:** Altered/inserted/removed pages won't verify - only original pages from the issuer will have valid hashes
- **Selective disclosure:** Share only relevant pages (e.g., bank statement page 3 of 12) while maintaining cryptographic verification
- **PDF generation:** Each PDF page includes verification footer during document generation

**Example multi-page bank statement:**
```
Page 1: Account summary, balance $50,000  verify:chase.com/stmt
Page 2: Transactions 01-10              verify:chase.com/stmt
Page 3: Transactions 11-20              verify:chase.com/stmt
```
Each page's text (including page number) creates a unique hash. You can verify page 2 independently without possessing pages 1 and 3. Prevents "page substitution attacks" where attacker swaps pages from different statements.

**Critical transparency requirement:** The verification app MUST clearly display which domain/authority verified the claim. Not just "VERIFIED" but "VERIFIED by degrees.ed.ac.uk" or "VERIFIED by intertek.com". This is essential for trust - users need to see immediately who is vouching for the claim.

**Domain complexity:** Domains vary globally - `ed.ac.uk` is a domain (UK academic), `degrees.ed.ac.uk` is a subdomain (different authority), `foobar.com.br` is a domain (Brazil), `example.co.uk` is a domain. The verifying authority should be displayed as the full hostname from the verification URL (e.g., `degrees.ed.ac.uk`, not truncated to `ed.ac.uk`).

**Optional identity standard:** A future standard like `https://www.ed.ac.uk/~shortWhoIsThisPlainText` could provide human-readable authority information, but for now, showing the full hostname provides basic transparency about who is performing the verification.

The system allows anyone to verify these printed claims without requiring access to the issuer's internal databases.  It will work if you're scanning the same on a laptop/tablet or bigger screen, though you risk [moiré patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moir%C3%A9_pattern).

## OCR Limitations: What Works Today vs Future Needs

## Rationale

- I want to use my choice of Verification App to verify the item you are showing me, not yours. Vendors should not force a single proprietary verifier; open, URL-based verification lets anyone use a trusted app of their choosing.

**Current OCR technology (Tesseract.js v5)**

| Document Type                     | OCR Feasibility      | Why                                                                    |
|-----------------------------------|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ✅ CV/resume text claims           | **Works now**        | Plain fonts (Arial, Times), simple layout, no decorations              |
| ✅ Employment verification letters | **Works now**        | Business letter format, standard fonts, clean layout                   |
| ✅ Till receipts                   | **Works now**        | Monospace fonts, structured format, thermal printing                   |
| ✅ Medical license wallet cards    | **Works now**        | Small but usually plain text, standard government fonts                |
| ✅ Simple certificates             | **Works now**        | If designed with OCR in mind - plain borders, standard fonts           |
| 🟡 Government IDs                 | **Could work maybe** | Can a text section be made that's separate to the photo/hologram       |
| ❌ Ornate degree certificates      | **Needs tech leap**  | Decorative fonts, calligraphy, seals, signatures, embossing, gold foil |
| ❌ Art authenticity certificates   | **Needs tech leap**  | Fancy typography, gallery branding, artistic layouts                   |
| ❌ Historical documents            | **Needs tech leap**  | Aged paper, faded ink, handwriting, non-standard fonts                 |

### The ornate certificate problem

Traditional university degrees, professional certifications, and art certificates are designed for **human prestige**, not machine readability:
- Gothic/blackletter fonts for institution names
- Cursive signatures from officials
- Embossed seals and raised ink
- Watermarks and security features
- Gold foil and decorative borders
- Multiple font sizes and styles
- Background patterns and imagery

**Tesseract chokes on these elements** - OCR accuracy drops from 95%+ (plain text) to <50% (ornate certificates).

**Practical solutions today:**

1. **Multi-representation claims** - The same credential can have MULTIPLE valid hashes (long-form, medium-form, short-form, etc.). See **[Multi_Representation_Verification.md](Multi_Representation_Verification.md)** for detailed explanation of how universities can support ornate wall certificates AND OCR-friendly CV claims AND social media profiles - unlimited representations of the same legal fact.

2. **OCR-optimized originals** - Organizations can print certificates with:
   - Registration marks around a plain-text verification box
   - Decorative elements OUTSIDE the scannable area (like the [bachelor-thaumatology-square.html](public/training-pages/bachelor-thaumatology-square.html) example with decoy text)
   - Standard fonts (Courier New, Arial) in the verification zone

3. **Manual text entry** - For ornate certificates, users could type the text manually rather than relying on OCR (loses convenience but maintains verification)

**Future improvements needed:**

- AI-powered OCR models trained on certificate layouts
- Pre-processing to detect and mask decorative elements
- Font-agnostic text recognition
- Integration with handwriting recognition
- Template-based extraction (if certificate format is known)

**Bottom line:** OCR-to-hash works **extremely well** for business documents, receipts, and plain-text credentials TODAY. For ornate certificates to work, either (a) issuers must design for OCR, or (b) OCR technology must quantum-leap forward.

## Privacy-First Architecture: Why Client-Side OCR Matters

**The privacy requirement:** OCR-to-hash verification **must** use client-side OCR. Sending document images to cloud OCR services (Google Cloud Vision, AWS Textract, Azure Computer Vision) would defeat the entire privacy model.

**What gets exposed to cloud services if using traditional OCR APIs:**
- ❌ Your degree certificate image (name, DOB, honors, university)
- ❌ Your medical license image (license number, specialization, photo)
- ❌ Your passport/driver's license (photo, DOB, address, ID numbers)
- ❌ Your salary receipt (employer, amount, transaction details, location)
- ❌ Employment verification letters (job title, dates, salary, manager names)
- ❌ All that PII flowing across networks, stored in cloud API logs, subject to subpoenas

**OCR-to-hash preserves privacy:**
- ✅ Image **never leaves your phone** - processed entirely on-device
- ✅ OCR happens locally using Tesseract.js (current) or on-device AI (future)
- ✅ Only the **SHA-256 hash** is computed and sent (one-way, can't reconstruct original text)
- ✅ Verification URL fetch (`https://example.com/hashes/abc123...`) reveals nothing about document content
- ✅ **Zero trust** in cloud providers, API vendors, or network intermediaries

**Current limitation (2025):** We use Tesseract.js because it runs client-side in the browser. It's a traditional computer vision algorithm from 2006 technology - excellent for plain text, struggles with ornate documents.

**Future evolution (2026-2027+):** On-device AI will transform this:

Modern phones already have neural processing units (NPUs) running sophisticated AI models **entirely on-device**:
- **Apple Intelligence** (iPhone 15 Pro+, A17 Pro chip) - vision models, document understanding
- **Google on-device Gemini** (Pixel 9+, Tensor G4 chip) - multimodal AI including OCR
- **Samsung Galaxy AI** (S24+, Snapdragon 8 Gen 3) - on-device vision processing
- **Qualcomm AI Engine** - NPUs in most modern Android phones

**iOS Live Text is already 90% there:** iPhone users (iOS 15+, released 2021) already have **Live Text** built into the Camera app - point your camera at any text and iOS extracts it instantly, on-device. For OCR-to-hash verification, we just need a few enhancements:
- Recognize `verify:` URLs in extracted text and trigger verification flow
- Apply text normalization rules (not just raw extraction)
- Compute SHA-256 hash on-device (Web Crypto API already available)
- Navigate to verification URL and display result

**The core OCR capability is already shipped and working on hundreds of millions of iPhones.** The "AI tweaks" needed are incremental feature additions, not fundamental technology development. Android's Lens feature offers similar capabilities.

**These on-device AI models can:**
- Match or exceed cloud OCR quality (GPT-4 Vision, Claude 3.5 Sonnet level)
- Handle ornate certificates, decorative fonts, calligraphy
- Process handwritten signatures and aged documents
- Understand multiple languages simultaneously
- Detect and mask decorative elements intelligently
- **Still 100% on-device** - images never leave the phone

**Tesseract becomes one tool in the AI's toolkit:**

```javascript
// Future API concept (illustrative)
async function extractTextForVerification(imageData) {
  // Try fast traditional OCR first
  let text = await Tesseract.ocr(imageData);

  // If confidence is low, ask on-device AI
  if (text.confidence < 0.85) {
    text = await OnDeviceAI.ocr(imageData, {
      mode: 'on-device-only',  // Privacy guarantee
      specialization: 'certificates',
      fallbackTools: ['vision-transformer', 'handwriting-recognition']
    });
  }

  return text;
}
```

**The privacy model stays identical:**
1. Image captured on phone
2. OCR processed on-device (Tesseract OR AI, never cloud)
3. Text normalized locally
4. SHA-256 hash computed locally
5. Only hash sent to verification endpoint
6. **No PII ever leaves the device**

**Why this matters for OCR-to-hash:**

Traditional verification systems require either:
- Calling the issuing organization (slow, manual, privacy-invasive)
- Uploading documents to verification portals (cloud storage, data breaches)
- Using cloud OCR APIs (third-party PII exposure)

OCR-to-hash verification offers a **fundamentally different privacy model:**
- No one sees your document except you
- No cloud service processes your PII
- Verification happens via cryptographic proof (hash lookup)
- Even the verifying organization doesn't receive document contents (just hash)

**On-device AI makes this practical for ALL document types:**
- Plain text receipts: ✅ Works today with Tesseract
- Business letters: ✅ Works today with Tesseract
- Wallet cards: ✅ Works today with Tesseract
- Ornate certificates: 🔜 Will work with on-device AI (2026+)
- Handwritten documents: 🔜 Will work with on-device AI (2026+)
- Historical documents: 🔜 Will work with on-device AI (2027+)

**The same privacy guarantees, just better OCR accuracy.**

**Analogy:** Apple's Face ID processes your face scan **entirely on-device** using the Secure Enclave. It never sends your face to Apple's servers. On-device AI for OCR-to-hash works the same way - sophisticated processing, zero cloud exposure.

**This is why client-side architecture is non-negotiable.** The entire security and privacy model depends on it. On-device AI simply makes the client-side approach practical for more document types.

## When OCR-to-Hash Verification Excels (vs QR Codes)

In short, if the claim is aimed at humans reading it and is printed on paper (or could be), it might be a candidate for this **non-blockchain** tech.

**Detailed use cases:** The following six scenarios demonstrate specific advantages of OCR-to-hash verification in real-world applications:

1. **[Education Credentials](Use_Cases/Educational_Degrees.md)** - degree/etc verification with privacy-preserving public registries
   <img src="https://paul-hammant.github.io/verific/screenshots/bachelor-thaumatology.png" width="200"> <img src="https://paul-hammant.github.io/verific/screenshots/master-applied-anthropics.png" width="200"> <img src="https://paul-hammant.github.io/verific/screenshots/doctorate-high-energy-magic.png" width="200">

2. **[B2B Product Certifications](Use_Cases/Product_Labeling.md)** - Preventing supplier impersonation fraud (MedPro/Intertek case)

3. **[Receipt Verification](Use_Cases/Sales_Receipts.md)** - Eliminating duplicate expense claims across employers
   <img src="https://paul-hammant.github.io/verific/screenshots/uk-coffee-shop.png" width="150"> <img src="https://paul-hammant.github.io/verific/screenshots/us-burrito-shop.png" width="150"> <img src="https://paul-hammant.github.io/verific/screenshots/hotel-receipt-scheidegg.png" width="150"> <img src="https://paul-hammant.github.io/verific/screenshots/us-home-improvement.png" width="150">

4. **[Medical Licenses](Use_Cases/Medical_License.md)** - Revocable credentials with domain-binding security
   <img src="https://paul-hammant.github.io/verific/screenshots/medical-license-revoked.png" width="200">

5. **[Government ID Verification](Use_Cases/Government_IDs.md)** - Cryptographic checks on plain text aspects (hotel checkin, traffic stop, entering a pub/bar)
   <img src="https://paul-hammant.github.io/verific/screenshots/driving-license-nordia-svg.png" width="250">

6. **[Voting Ballot Proof](Use_Cases/Voting_Proof.md)** - Verifiable vote counting with independent auditor confirmation

There are more potential OCR-to-Hash uses listed below.

QR and bar codes are much better for machine reading and might suit routing situations where authenticity does not need to be double checked by humans at every step.  An example would be a package already in the Fedex global distribution system. Where it is and needs to go next is the key piece aided by the QR/bar codes. It does not need to be validated over by humans. The printed destination is still on the label, but isn't used again until the last 100 meters or yards when the delivery associate has it in hand, and the recipient glances at it too for routing to individuals hopefully nearby.

## Decision Criteria: OCR-to-Hash vs QR Code

**OCR-to-Hash is BEST when:**

| Criterion                    | Why It Matters                                                       | CV Example                                                      |
|------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Human readability primary    | Document is for humans first, verification is secondary              | Interviewer reads "First Class Honours", verifies if suspicious |
| Professional appearance      | Visual clutter unacceptable                                          | CV must look polished, not technical                            |
| Multiple independent claims  | Each claim verified separately                                       | Degree + 3 employers + 2 certs = 6 verifications                |
| Privacy-preserving           | Hash should NOT be publicly visible                                  | No public registry of "who graduated where"                     |
| Authorized verification only | Only parties with physical doc should verify                         | Only interviewer with CV in hand can verify                     |
| Formal certificate format    | Ornate, bordered, human-readable                                     | Matches existing certificate design patterns                    |
| Text already exists          | Not adding verification to existing system, verification IS the text | The degree claim is the text itself                             |

**QR Code is BEST when:**

| Criterion                    | Why It Matters                                | Counter-example                      |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Machine processing primary   | Humans don't need to read it                  | Shipping labels, inventory tags      |
| Space constrained            | Label too small for registration marks + text | Specimen tubes, tiny product labels  |
| Speed critical               | Instant scan, no OCR processing time          | Boarding passes, event tickets       |
| Already machine-focused      | Document already uses barcodes                | Retail receipts, package tracking    |
| Real-time status             | QR points to live page with current status    | Product recall page (status changes) |
| Public verification expected | Anyone should be able to verify               | Authenticity tags on luxury goods    |

## The Dividing Line

**Ask yourself:** *"Would a human need to read and understand this text for the document to serve its primary purpose?"*

- **YES** → OCR-to-hash (CV, certificate, legal document, driver's license, printed receipts for store purchases)
- **NO** → QR code (shipping label, inventory tag, boarding pass)

## Strong Use Cases for OCR-to-Hash

- ✅ Academic degrees/certificates
- ✅ Professional licenses (wallet cards - medical, legal, engineering)
- ✅ Employment verification letters
- ✅ Formal certifications (safety, medical, legal documents)
- ✅ Government IDs (driver's licenses, passports) - for non-government verifiers
- ✅ Birth/death certificates, legal documents
- ✅ Court documents, notarized attestations
- ✅ Tax receipts for expense claims (prevents double-expensing)

## Where QR Codes Are Actually Better

- ❌ Shipping labels - already uses barcodes, speed matters, machine-only, highly temporal
- ❌ Price tags - retail and shippers already has barcode infrastructure
- ❌ Event tickets - speed of entry critical
- ❌ Component traceability - tiny labels, machine scanning
- ❌ Gift cards - already use barcodes/magnetic stripe

## Technology Quick Start

**For Developers:**

**Run Locally:**
```bash
cd public
python3 -m http.server 8000
# Open http://localhost:8000
```

No `npm install` needed - pure HTML/CSS/JS with Tesseract.js from CDN.

**Deploy:**

This proof of concept uses GitHub Pages for convenience, but production deployments should use proper hosting (CDN, static site hosting, etc.):

```bash
git push origin main
# Enable GitHub Pages in repo settings → Pages → Source: /public
# Access at: https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/YOUR_REPO/
```

## Usage

1. Open app on phone, click "Start Camera"
2. Position registration marks around document text + URL
3. Click "Capture & Verify"
4. See ✅ green "VERIFIED" or ❌ red "FAILS VERIFICATION"

## For Organizations Creating Verifiable Documents

To create verifiable documents:

1. Generate certification text
2. Normalize it (Unicode normalization + whitespace rules - see NORMALIZATION.md)
3. Compute SHA-256 hash
4. Print text within registration marks + base URL: `verify:your-org.com/c` (use Courier New font)

"SUPERSEDED" would not link to a replacement SHA-256 URL that'd have "OK", nor would HTTP's 302 do the same. The point is the requester should already know the the plain-text that would culminate in a verification lookup.

**Fields:**
- `issuer` (optional) - Name of the issuing organization
- `claimType` (optional) - Type of claim (e.g., "degree", "license", "certification")
- `parentAuthorities` (optional) - Array of URLs linking to parent/accrediting organizations that authorize this issuer
- `responseTypes` (optional) - Dictionary defining possible response statuses beyond "OK", each with:
  - `class` - Either "affirming" or "denying" (determines UI color/icon)
  - `text` - Human-readable explanation of what this status means
  - `link` - URL to a page with more information about this status
- `retentionLaws` (optional) - Array of governing laws/regulations for data retention and sharing, each with:
  - `jurisdiction` - Geographic region or legal system (e.g., "European Union", "California", "Japan")
  - `law` - Name/citation of the specific law or regulation
  - `link` - URL to the official text or authoritative explanation
  - `summary` - Plain-language explanation of retention period and sharing constraints
- `tesseract` (optional) - Tesseract.js configuration for improved OCR accuracy

The app will automatically fetch this file and use the Tesseract settings if initial OCR fails (404 response).

**Parent Authorities Examples:**

The `parentAuthorities` field establishes a chain of trust through simple URL links (no PKI required):

- **University degree** → Accreditation body (e.g., regional accreditor's member list)
- **Medical license** → State medical board registry
- **Professional certification** → Certifying organization's approved training providers list
- **Food safety cert** → Health department's licensed facilities page
- **Product certification** → Standards body's certified labs directory

Example for a university: See [github.com/paul-hammant/verific/blob/main/public/c/.verific-meta.json](https://github.com/paul-hammant/verific/blob/main/public/c/.verific-meta.json

**Why This Matters:**

Europe's GDPR's has a vague "if strictly necessary" clause, but many jurisdictions have specific, concrete retention periods and explicit rules about:

- **Retention duration**: How long the issuer must/may keep the data (e.g., 4 years, 7 years, 10 years, indefinitely)
- **Mandatory sharing**: Who the data **must** be shared with (government agencies, regulators, auditors)
- **Permissible sharing**: Who the data **may** be shared with (background check companies, other employers, researchers)
- **Prohibited sharing**: What the data **cannot** be used for (e.g., "will not be sold to marketers and alike")

The `retentionLaws` field makes these rules transparent to the person whose data is being verified.

### Hash Storage vs Full-Text Storage: Legal Implications

Companies storing aspects of the data behind verifications. 

**Storing the SHA-256 hash alone** (without the underlying text) is technically easy but **practically useless**:

- The hash proves nothing without the ability to verify it (i.e., without storing the original text). 
- You cannot reconstruct the original claim from the hash. Well, not without literal magic.
- There is no value in a database of orphaned hashes

**Storing the claim text** (with or without the hash) is what organizations actually do, and **retention/sharing laws apply to this stored text**, not the hash. The laws existed and applied before this idea to verify claims using a SHA-256 system.

### Worked Example: Recruitment Portal

**Scenario:** A candidate submits their CV/resume to a recruitment portal, which includes:

- Degree certificate from Edinburgh University (First-class honours) - verified via OCR-to-hash
- Employment letter from Microsoft - verified via OCR-to-hash

**What the recruitment portal stores:**

1. ✅ The full CV/resume text (including qualification and employment claims)
2. ✅ Maybe the SHA-256 hashes from the verified documents
3. ✅ The verification base URLs that proved the claims are authentic. At least with the SHA-256 they do.  The text to verification sequence could be redone at any stage of course.

**Legal permissions - What the portal CAN do:**
- ✅ Store the CV/resume (candidate gave consent when submitting)
- ✅ Share the CV/resume with specific clients (the hiring company) because the applicant was applying for a job through the portal - their entire purpose for uploading their CV/resume.
- ✅ Show verified status: "Degree verified ✓" and "Employment verified ✓" Both back to the candidate and to the prospective employer.

**Legal constraints - What the portal CANNOT do:**
- ❌ Share the CV/resume with Palantir Technologies (for example) no consent/legitimate interest.
- ❌ Sell the CV data to marketing companies
- ❌ Keep the CV indefinitely after the candidate withdraws consent (GDPR Article 17)

**Initial client conversation:**

Portal: "We have a matching candidate who graduated Edinburgh University
         with First-class honours (verified ✓) and is currently working
         at Microsoft (verified ✓). Are you interested in seeing their
         full CV?"

Client: "Yes, send over their details."

Portal: Shares the full CV. With or without verification proof - the client could or perhaps should redo the same verifications.

**What "verified ✓" means:**

- The candidate submitted physical documents (degree certificate, employment letter), OR scans there of OR the already-extracted and normalized text from the same.
- If physical scans, the portal scanned them using OCR-to-hash verification "OK" vs 404 response, etc
- The issuing organizations (Edinburgh University, Microsoft) confirmed authenticity via HTTP 200 + "OK" and that gets noted "claims made in CV all verified"

**Key insight:** The retention laws govern **the underlying text** (the CV, the degree claim, the employment history, the financial services contract/transaction), not the hash. The hash is merely a cryptographic proof that helps verify authenticity, but the legal obligations attach to the personal data being stored and shared.

## Verification Charges: Free vs Paid

Organizations must decide whether to offer free verification or charge for lookups. The marginal infrastructure cost is extremely low (≈$0.000005 per verification using serverless platforms), but strategic considerations vary:

- **Universities and public institutions** often offer free verification as part of their mission, funded by tuition/taxes
- **Commercial certification bodies** may charge to fund operations and prevent abuse
- **Hybrid freemium models** provide free access for individuals while monetizing commercial bulk verification

For detailed analysis of pricing models, implementation costs, the Bloomberg-style recurring revenue approach, and decision frameworks for issuers, see **[Verification_Charges.md](Verification_Charges.md)**.

**Why notary services need OCR-to-hash:**

1. **Prevents forged notarizations:** Fake notary seals/stamps enable document fraud (forged deeds, fake powers of attorney, forged wills)
2. **Notary commission verification:** Domain binding verifies notary public is commissioned by state - prevents fake notaries
3. **State notary databases:** Many states maintain online notary commission databases - OCR-to-hash enables cryptographic verification against database
4. **High-stakes documents:** Real estate deeds (permanent ownership), wills (estate disputes), powers of attorney (financial authority), apostilles (international fraud)
5. **Tamper-evident seals:** Notary seal impressions suitable for OCR - prevents seal alteration or reproduction
6. **Long retention periods:** Permanent records for deeds/wills, 10-20 years for legal proceedings
7. **Cross-border fraud:** Apostilles authenticate documents internationally - prevents fake Hague Convention certifications
8. **Remote online notarization (RON):** Electronic notarizations need cryptographic verification - prevents RON platform fraud

**Real-world fraud examples:**

- **Forged deed notarizations:** Criminals forge notary seals on fake property deeds, steal real estate ownership ($billions in property fraud)
- **Fake power of attorney:** Elderly victim's signature forged, fake notarization enables financial exploitation ($30bn+ annual elder fraud)
- **Fake apostilles:** Fraudulent apostille certifications on fake diplomas for immigration/employment ($100M+ visa fraud)
- **Unauthorized notary practice:** Non-notaries create fake notary seals, provide illegal notary services (criminal prosecution in all states)
- **Backdated notarizations:** Notaries backdate acknowledgments to meet filing deadlines (notary commission revocation)
- **Fake certified copies:** Immigration fraud using fake certified passport copies, fake diploma copies
- **Notario fraud (immigration):** Unauthorized practitioners impersonate notaries, provide fake immigration services ($billions targeting immigrant communities)
- **Fake travel consent letters:** Child abduction using forged parental consent with fake notarization

**Regulatory frameworks:**

- **State notary commissions:** Every state regulates notaries public - commission requirements, bonding, surety bonds, continuing education
- **Uniform Law Commission:** Revised Uniform Law on Notarial Acts (RULONA) - model state legislation
- **National Notary Association (NNA):** Professional standards, best practices, notary education
- **Hague Convention (Apostille):** Treaty for international document authentication (abolishes legalization requirement)
- **Remote Online Notarization (RON):** State-specific RON enabling laws (Virginia first in 2012, now 40+ states)
- **Criminal penalties:** Unauthorized notary practice (misdemeanor/felony), forged notarization (felony fraud), commission violations (revocation + fines)

**State-specific notary requirements:**

- **Commission term:** 4 years (most states), 10 years (Colorado)
- **Surety bond:** $1,000-$15,000 required (California $15,000, Texas $10,000)
- **Journal requirements:** Mandatory in California, Florida, Nevada, Pennsylvania - optional in most states
- **Notary seal:** Embosser or rubber stamp (state-specific requirements)
- **RON authorization:** 40+ states authorize remote online notarization (as of 2023)

**Real-world fraud examples:**

- **Mortgage fraud epidemic (2005-2008):** Fake employment letters, inflated pay stubs, forged bank statements enabled billions in fraudulent loans. OCR-to-hash would have detected forgeries instantly via domain binding verification.
- **Trade-based money laundering:** Over/under-invoicing for goods, fake certificates of origin, forged bills of lading enable $2-5 trillion annual illicit financial flows (UN estimate). OCR-to-hash domain binding prevents document forgery.
- **Fake cashier's checks:** "Overpayment scams" where victim receives fake cashier's check, deposits it (clears initially), sends refund, then check reverses days later. OCR-to-hash verification would reveal fake check before victim loses money.
- **Bernard Madoff Ponzi scheme:** Fake brokerage statements for decades. If statements had OCR-to-hash verification from actual custodian banks, fraud would have been detected by any investor verifying their balance.

**Regulatory drivers:**

- **USA:** Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), Patriot Act, FinCEN CDD Rule, OFAC sanctions, Dodd-Frank, SEC/FINRA regulations
- **EU:** AML Directives (5AMLD, 6AMLD), GDPR (conflicts with KYC retention), MiFID II, PSD2
- **Global:** FATF recommendations, Basel AML Index, Wolfsberg Principles, UCP 600 (trade finance)

**Why actuarial documents need OCR-to-hash:**

1. **Multi-billion dollar liabilities:** Pension plans, insurance reserves represent trillions in obligations
2. **Credential verification:** Domain binding confirms actuary holds FSA, FCAS, EA, FIA credentials
3. **Regulatory compliance:** ERISA, NAIC, state insurance departments require actuarial certifications
4. **Fraud prevention:** Prevents fabricated valuations enabling pension/insurance insolvency
5. **Long retention periods:** 7-50 years for policy lifetimes and regulatory audits
6. **Technical complexity:** Multi-page reports with tables, assumptions - per-page verification prevents tampering
7. **Consumer protection:** Prevents fraudulent benefit calculations, rate justifications, reserve inadequacies

**Real-world fraud examples:**

- **Equitable Life collapse (UK, 2000):** Inadequate actuarial reserves for guaranteed annuity rates led to insolvency, £4bn+ losses
- **Penn Treaty insurance failure (USA, 2017):** Fraudulent long-term care insurance reserves, state takeover
- **Social Security statement fraud:** Fake SSA statements used for loan applications, inflated earnings history
- **Pension underfunding:** Fraudulent actuarial valuations enable employers to underfund pension obligations
- **Rate increase fraud:** Inflated medical cost trend assumptions justify excessive health insurance rate increases

**Regulatory frameworks:**

- **USA:** ERISA (pension plans), NAIC Model Audit Rule (insurance reserves), Actuarial Standards Board (ASOPs), state insurance departments
- **Credentialing bodies:** Society of Actuaries (FSA, ASA), Casualty Actuarial Society (FCAS, ACAS), Enrolled Actuaries (EA - IRS/DOL), Institute and Faculty of Actuaries (FIA - UK)
- **International:** International Actuarial Association (IAA), Solvency II (EU insurance), IAIS (global insurance standards)

**Why Lloyd's specialty classes need OCR-to-hash:**

1. **Extreme values:** Satellite insurance ($200M-$500M), P&I pollution ($1bn+), fine art exhibitions ($100M-$500M)
2. **International verification:** Lloyd's syndicates, P&I clubs, port state control need cryptographic verification
3. **Niche markets:** Specialists often verify coverage (completion guarantors for films, P&I clubs for vessels, space insurers for satellites)
4. **Long claims tails:** P&I club claims can emerge 20+ years later (asbestos exposure on ships)
5. **Regulatory compliance:** TRIPRA (terrorism), OPA 90 (oil pollution), ERISA (pension trustees), IMO/ISM codes (marine)
6. **High fraud risk:** Fake completion bonds enable film financing fraud, fake P&I certificates enable port violations
7. **Confidential coverage:** K&R, cyber extortion policies kept confidential - verification without disclosure critical

**Real-world fraud examples:**

- **Fake P&I certificates:** Vessels present forged Protection & Indemnity certificates to port authorities, later cause $100M+ pollution incidents with no coverage
- **Fake film completion bonds:** Producers submit forged completion bonds to secure film financing, then abandon production after receiving funds
- **Fake satellite insurance:** Launch providers claim insurance coverage that doesn't exist, satellite loss exposes lack of coverage
- **Fake war risk certificates:** Vessels transit high-risk piracy areas (Gulf of Aden) with forged war risk coverage, owners exposed to multi-million dollar hijacking ransoms
- **Fake prize indemnity:** Contest sponsors claim prize coverage for hole-in-one contests, then refuse to pay winner claiming "insurance denied" when winner actually achieves hole-in-one
- **Fake political risk insurance:** Infrastructure investors claim expropriation coverage that was never purchased, exposed when host government nationalizes assets

**Regulatory frameworks:**

- **Maritime:** International Maritime Organization (IMO), ISM Code, SOLAS, Oil Pollution Act 1990 (OPA 90), port state control
- **Lloyd's:** Lloyd's of London market, Financial Conduct Authority (FCA UK), Solvency II
- **USA specialty:** TRIPRA (terrorism), ERISA (pension trustees), FAA/FCC (satellite)
- **International:** Joint War Committee (war risk zones), International Group of P&I Clubs, MIGA/OPIC (political risk)
- **Trade credit:** Export credit agencies (ECA), Berne Union, ICC rules

**Why claims/reinsurance documents need OCR-to-hash:**

1. **Multi-million dollar fraud risk:** Large loss reports, bordereaux, facultative certificates represent millions to billions in transfers
2. **Tamper-evident damage assessments:** Prevents altering adjuster reports, expert opinions, valuations post-issuance
3. **Treaty compliance:** Reinsurance contracts require timely, accurate reporting - prevents late reporting fraud
4. **International market verification:** London/Bermuda reinsurance market, Lloyd's syndicates need cryptographic verification
5. **Long claims tails:** Some claims develop over decades - documentation must remain verifiable
6. **Regulatory oversight:** State insurance departments, AM Best, S&P ratings agencies audit reinsurance documentation
7. **Multi-page technical documents:** Bordereaux, loss runs, expert reports are lengthy - per-page verification prevents page substitution
8. **Prevents double-recovery:** Salvage documentation, reinsurance recovery prevents claiming same loss multiple times

**Real-world fraud examples:**

- **Fabricated adjuster reports:** Independent adjusters inflate damage assessments to increase claim payouts
- **Altered proof of loss:** Claimants change claimed amounts after submission, before insurer review
- **Late reinsurance notifications:** Ceding companies delay large loss notices beyond treaty reporting deadlines, reinsurers deny coverage
- **Fraudulent bordereaux:** Ceding companies submit fake premium bordereaux to collect reinsurance commissions on non-existent policies
- **Fake facultative certificates:** Insurers claim reinsurance coverage that was never actually placed, leading to insolvency when large loss occurs
- **Salvage fraud:** Claimants receive total loss payment but keep/resell salvage without disclosure
- **Commutation fraud:** Fabricated early termination agreements to escape future claims obligations

**Regulatory frameworks:**

- **USA:** State insurance departments, NAIC reinsurance accounting standards, SSAP 62 (reinsurance accounting), Form A/Schedule F filings
- **International:** Lloyd's of London market, Bermuda Monetary Authority (BMA), IAIS reinsurance principles, Solvency II (EU)
- **Industry standards:** ARIAS (arbitration), LMA (London Market Association) contracts, ACORD forms, ISO catastrophe codes
- **Claims management:** Adjuster licensing (state requirements), expert witness credentials, structured settlement regulations

**Why insurance documents need OCR-to-hash:**

1. **Certificate of insurance fraud:** Fake COIs are extremely common - contractors submit forged certificates to win contracts
2. **Uninsured motorist fraud:** $14bn annual USA cost from fake auto insurance cards
3. **Real-time verification:** Police, DMV, contractors can verify insurance instantly at traffic stops, accidents, job sites
4. **Claims fraud prevention:** Prevents inflated repair estimates, prior damage fraud, arson fraud
5. **Long claims tails:** Some policies (product liability, environmental, pollution) have 20-30+ year claims tails
6. **High-value policies:** Commercial policies often have $1M-$100M+ coverage limits - fraud risk is enormous
7. **Regulatory compliance:** State insurance departments, DOT, OSHA, surety bonding requirements
8. **Multi-page verification:** Policies and claims documentation often multi-page - per-page verification prevents tampering

**Real-world fraud examples:**

- **Fake certificates of insurance:** Contractors forge COIs showing $1M-$2M general liability coverage, win contract, then injury occurs revealing no actual insurance
- **Uninsured motorist fraud:** Drivers create fake auto insurance ID cards to avoid $1,000-$3,000 annual premiums
- **Contractor surety bond fraud:** Contractors forge performance bonds for public works projects, then abandon jobs after payment
- **Auto insurance fraud:** Staged accidents, inflated repair estimates, claiming prior damage as new damage ($40bn annual USA fraud)
- **Homeowners insurance fraud:** Arson for insurance proceeds, inflated contents claims, fake water damage ($13bn annual USA fraud)
- **Workers' compensation fraud:** Employers operate without coverage, then injured employee has no recourse ($30bn annual USA unpaid claims)

**Regulatory frameworks:**

- **USA:** State insurance departments, NAIC, DOT (commercial auto), OSHA (workers' comp), Miller Act (surety bonds), FAA (aviation), USDA (crop insurance)
- **Auto insurance verification:** State DMV databases, police traffic stops, accident verification
- **Commercial insurance:** Certificate holder verification requirements, contractual insurance requirements
- **International:** Solvency II (EU), Lloyd's of London market, International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS)

**Why fintech needs OCR-to-hash:**

- **Digital-native but print receipts:** Fintech platforms are digital-first, but still generate printed/PDF receipts for tax reporting, dispute resolution, and regulatory compliance.
- **Prevents screenshot fraud:** P2P payment screenshots easily forged. OCR-to-hash domain binding proves payment actually came from Venmo/Zelle/etc.
- **Regulatory convergence:** Neo-banks, BNPL, remittances all face same KYC/AML rules as traditional banks - need same document verification standards.
- **Gig economy tax crisis:** 1099 contractors need verifiable income records. Platforms manipulating payouts is common complaint.
- **Cross-border complexity:** Remittances, mobile money (M-Pesa) serve unbanked populations - printed receipts are primary proof of payment.
- **Crowdfunding fraud:** Kickstarter/Indiegogo have fraud problem. Equity crowdfunding (StartEngine) involves real securities - needs same verification as stock certificates.
- **Open Banking privacy:** PSD2 consent forms need tamper-evident records - prevents "I never authorized this app" disputes.

**Real-world examples:**

- **Venmo screenshot fraud:** Users alter screenshots of payments to fake proof of payment. OCR-to-hash would detect forgeries.
- **Gig worker earnings disputes:** Uber/Lyft drivers claim platform manipulates earnings. Verifiable payout receipts would provide tamper-evident proof.
- **BNPL merchant impersonation:** Fake "Buy Now, Pay Later" checkout pages steal card details. Merchant verification certificates with domain binding would prevent this.
- **Remittance fee disputes:** Western Union customers dispute fees/exchange rates. Tamper-evident receipts would resolve disputes instantly.

**Why government permits need OCR-to-hash:**

1. **Public safety:** Fake permits enable unlicensed contractors, food service, firearms dealers, hazmat handlers - direct public danger
2. **Revenue loss:** Unpermitted businesses avoid licensing fees, building permit fees ($billions in municipal revenue)
3. **Liability protection:** Fake permits expose property owners, employers, event organizers to massive liability (unlicensed contractors, unpermitted construction)
4. **Environmental compliance:** Fake environmental permits enable illegal pollution, wetland destruction, endangered species violations
5. **Consumer protection:** Fake professional licenses enable unlicensed practitioners (cosmetology, massage, pest control, locksmiths)
6. **Code enforcement:** Inspectors verify permits on-site - domain binding prevents fake permit fraud
7. **High-value assets:** Liquor licenses worth $10K-$500K+, taxi medallions $100K-$1M - fraud target
8. **Criminal penalties:** Many permit violations carry criminal prosecution - fake FFL (firearms), hazmat permits, ESA violations

**Real-world fraud examples:**

- **Fake contractor licenses:** Unlicensed contractors use fake permits, perform substandard work, disappear after payment (billions in annual fraud)
- **Fake health permits:** Restaurants operate with fake health permits, cause foodborne illness outbreaks
- **Fake liquor licenses:** Bars operate with fake ABC licenses, sell alcohol illegally, avoid liquor tax
- **Fake FFL licenses:** Illegal gun dealers create fake FFL licenses to sell firearms without background checks
- **Fake environmental permits:** Industrial facilities forge discharge/air permits, illegally pollute waterways
- **Unpermitted construction:** Property owners skip building permits to avoid fees, create unsafe structures (electrical fires, building collapses)
- **Fake food handler certificates:** Restaurant workers purchase fake ServSafe certificates online, lack proper food safety training
- **Predatory towing scams:** Fake tow permits used by predatory tow companies to steal vehicles

**Regulatory frameworks:**

- **Federal:** ATF (firearms), EPA (environmental permits), USACE (wetlands), USFWS (endangered species), OSHA (occupational safety)
- **State:** State licensing boards (professional licenses), ABC/liquor control (alcohol licenses), department of agriculture (pest control, food safety)
- **Local:** Building departments, health departments, planning/zoning, business license offices, police/fire departments (event permits)
- **Enforcement:** Code enforcement officers, inspectors (building, health, fire, environmental), police verification, license board investigations

**Why safety inspections and postings need OCR-to-hash:**

1. **Life safety critical:** Fake elevator certificates, fire system inspections, emergency exit maps enable deadly building failures
2. **Public verification:** Passengers, employees, customers verify posted certificates in elevators, workplaces, pools
3. **Inspector accountability:** Domain binding verifies licensed inspector performed actual inspection - prevents desk audits
4. **Regulatory enforcement:** OSHA, fire marshals, building inspectors verify posted certificates during inspections
5. **Criminal liability:** Uninspected elevators, boilers, cranes cause deaths - criminal prosecution for fake certificates
6. **Employee rights protection:** Mandatory labor law posters inform workers of rights - fake posters suppress unionization, wage claims
7. **High penalties:** Missing OSHA posters $15,625, fake elevator certificates criminal prosecution, uninspected crane operation felony
8. **Annual compliance:** Most inspections annual - expired certificates easily spotted, fake current-year certificates harder to detect without verification

**Real-world fraud examples:**

- **Fake elevator certificates:** Building owners skip costly elevator inspections ($500-$2,000), post fake certificates - elevator failures cause deaths
- **Fake fire extinguisher tags:** Facility managers skip annual inspections ($50-$100/extinguisher), apply fake tags - extinguishers fail during fires
- **Fake boiler certificates:** Property owners avoid inspection costs ($200-$500), post fake certificates - boiler explosions destroy buildings
- **Fake crane certificates:** Construction companies skip load testing ($1,000-$5,000), operate with fake certificates - crane collapses kill workers
- **Fake OSHA posters:** Employers post outdated/fake labor law posters to suppress employee rights (union organizing, wage claims, FMLA leave)
- **Fake workers' comp postings:** Uninsured employers post fake insurance certificates - injured workers have no coverage
- **Fake pool inspection certificates:** Pool operators skip water testing ($100-$300), post fake certificates - disease outbreaks (Legionella, crypto)
- **Desk audit fraud:** Inspectors issue certificates without actual inspection, collect fees - uninspected equipment causes deaths

**Regulatory frameworks:**

- **Federal:** OSHA (workplace safety, mandatory postings), DOL (wage/labor law posters), EPA (UST inspections, backflow prevention), EEOC (EEO posters), NLRB (union rights)
- **Building codes:** International Building Code (IBC), International Fire Code (IFC), NFPA codes (fire protection, life safety)
- **Safety standards:** ASME (elevators, boilers, pressure vessels), ASTM (playground equipment, amusement rides), ASHRAE (HVAC), CPSC (playground safety)
- **State/local:** Building departments (elevator, boiler inspections), fire marshals (fire systems, extinguishers), health departments (pools, backflow), labor departments (state postings)
- **Enforcement:** OSHA inspections, building code enforcement, fire marshal inspections, insurance company audits, employee complaints

**Criminal penalties:**

- **Uninspected elevator operation:** Felony in many states (NY Penal Law), criminal prosecution after deaths
- **Fake OSHA compliance:** Willful violations $145,027 per violation, criminal prosecution for fatalities (6 months-20 years prison)
- **Crane operation without inspection:** OSHA serious violation $16,131 per violation, criminal prosecution for crane collapse deaths
- **Boiler explosion deaths:** Criminal negligence, manslaughter charges for building owners skipping inspections

**Why immigration/visa documents need OCR-to-hash:**

1. **High-stakes fraud:** Fake visas, work permits, green cards enable illegal immigration, unauthorized employment, identity fraud
2. **Border security:** CBP/immigration officers verify documents at entry - domain binding prevents fake government approvals
3. **Employer I-9 compliance:** Employers must verify work authorization - prevents hiring unauthorized workers (civil/criminal penalties)
4. **Privacy protection (SHA-512):** Immigration documents contain sensitive personal data - SHA-512 prevents brute-force enumeration
5. **Government domain verification:** Domain binding to .gov domains (cbp.gov, uscis.gov) prevents fake government documents
6. **Multi-year validity periods:** Visas, green cards valid for years/decades - long-term verification essential
7. **Fraud targeting vulnerable populations:** Immigration scams prey on applicants - OCR-to-hash prevents fake appointment notices, fake attorneys
8. **Regulatory compliance:** I-9 employment eligibility, public charge rules, overstay prevention

**Real-world fraud examples:**

- **Fake ESTA approvals:** Scam websites charge $79+ for "ESTA processing" and provide fake approval confirmations (real ESTA costs $21 via cbp.gov)
- **Fake work permits:** Unauthorized workers purchase forged EAD cards, H-1B approvals - employers face civil/criminal penalties for hiring
- **Fake green cards:** Counterfeit permanent residence cards sold to unauthorized immigrants ($5,000-$15,000 typical)
- **Notario fraud:** Unauthorized practitioners impersonate immigration attorneys, provide fake legal services, submit fraudulent applications
- **Fake visa stamps:** Travelers purchase fake visa stamps to avoid consular interviews - detected at border, result in visa denial/deportation
- **Fake asylum receipts:** Unauthorized workers claim asylum pending status with fake receipts to obtain work authorization
- **I-94 fraud:** Fake arrival/departure records to hide overstays, claim authorized entry when entered illegally
- **Immigration fee scams:** Fake payment receipts for biometrics, DS-160, I-901 SEVIS - application rejected for unpaid fees

**Regulatory frameworks:**

- **USA:** Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), USCIS, CBP, ICE, EOIR (immigration courts), State Department (consular processing), I-9 employment eligibility
- **UK:** UK Visas and Immigration (UKVI), Home Office, Points-Based System, Indefinite Leave to Remain (ILR), Right to Work checks
- **Canada:** Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC), Express Entry, Permanent Residence, Work Permits
- **EU/Schengen:** Schengen Visa, EU Blue Card, Residence Permits, Freedom of Movement (EEA nationals)
- **Australia:** Department of Home Affairs, Skilled Migration Program, Temporary/Permanent Residence, eVisitor/ETA
- **International:** UNHCR (refugee protection), IOM (migration), ICAO (travel documents), Interpol (stolen/lost travel documents)

**Enforcement and penalties:**

- **USA I-9 penalties:** $252-$2,507 per unauthorized worker (civil), criminal prosecution for pattern/practice violations
- **Visa fraud:** 10 years imprisonment (18 USC 1546), visa denial, removal/deportation, permanent inadmissibility
- **Unauthorized practice of immigration law:** Criminal prosecution, bar complaints, client harm lawsuits
- **Border crossing fraud:** Expedited removal, 5-year/permanent bars to re-entry, criminal prosecution

**Why freight/logistics documents need OCR-to-hash:**

1. **Document of title fraud:** Negotiable B/L and warehouse receipts convey cargo ownership - tampering steals cargo
2. **Customs fraud prevention:** Commercial invoices, certificates of origin prevent tariff evasion, smuggling
3. **Carrier liability:** CMR consignment notes, air waybills establish carrier liability limits - prevent altered claims
4. **Safety compliance:** Hazmat declarations (DGR, ADR, DOT) prevent misdeclared dangerous goods (aircraft/highway safety)
5. **High cargo values:** Typical international shipments $10K-$10M+ - fraud risk is enormous
6. **Multi-party verification:** Shippers, carriers, customs, consignees, insurers all need tamper-evident documents
7. **Regulatory compliance:** SOLAS (VGM), IATA (DGR), CMR Convention, FMC (NVOCC), CBP/customs
8. **Cross-border trade:** International shipments require verifiable documentation across jurisdictions

**Real-world fraud examples:**

- **Fake bills of lading:** Fraudsters create fake negotiable B/L, present to port terminal, steal cargo worth $1M-$10M+
- **Customs fraud:** Altered commercial invoices undervalue goods to evade import duties (billions in annual tariff evasion)
- **Certificate of origin fraud:** Fake certificates claim goods originate in FTA countries to avoid tariffs (e.g., Chinese goods claimed as Mexican under USMCA)
- **Warehouse receipt fraud:** Fake negotiable warehouse receipts used as collateral for loans - inventory doesn't exist (Qingdao port scandal 2014, $500M+ fraud)
- **Freight forwarder fraud:** Fake freight forwarder liability insurance - shipment lost, no coverage for cargo owner
- **Hazmat misdeclaration:** Shippers falsely declare dangerous goods as non-hazardous to avoid fees/restrictions - aircraft safety risk
- **Temperature excursion fraud:** Cold chain operators hide temperature violations (spoiled pharmaceuticals/food shipped anyway)

**Regulatory frameworks:**

- **Maritime:** SOLAS (Safety of Life at Sea), CMR Convention (road freight), Hague-Visby Rules (B/L liability), Rotterdam Rules
- **Aviation:** IATA Dangerous Goods Regulations (DGR), Montreal Convention (air carrier liability)
- **Customs:** WCO (World Customs Organization), Harmonized System (HS codes), CBP (USA), HMRC (UK), free trade agreements (USMCA, EU FTAs)
- **Trucking:** ADR (EU hazmat), DOT/FMCSA (USA commercial vehicles), Hours of Service regulations
- **Freight forwarding:** FMC (Federal Maritime Commission - NVOCC regulation), FIATA (freight forwarder standards)
- **Cold chain:** FDA FSMA (Food Safety Modernization Act), EU GDP (Good Distribution Practice for pharmaceuticals)

1. **Expense fraud prevention:** Travel expenses are high-fraud risk category - altered hotel bills, fake receipts, inflated costs
2. **Refund disputes:** Airlines/hotels claiming "no refund issued" when canceling - cryptographic proof prevents disputes
3. **Booking scams:** Fake booking confirmations from scam websites - domain binding verifies legitimate travel provider
4. **Loyalty program fraud:** Fake frequent flyer/hotel statements for selling points/miles
5. **Damage disputes:** Car rental damage claims, baggage damage - prevents "he said/she said" disputes with tamper-evident reports
6. **Regulatory compliance:** EU261 airline compensation, Montreal Convention baggage liability, FTC resort fee disclosure
7. **High transaction values:** Business class flights ($5K-$15K), luxury hotels ($500-$2K/night), cruises ($5K-$50K)
8. **Multi-page documents:** Hotel folios, cruise statements, travel packages - per-page verification prevents tampering

**Real-world fraud examples:**

- **Fake hotel booking confirmations:** Scam booking sites send fake confirmations, traveler arrives to find no reservation (or hotel doesn't exist)
- **Inflated hotel bills for expense claims:** Employees alter hotel folio PDFs to increase amounts for expense reimbursement
- **Airline refund fraud:** Airline claims "we already refunded you" when traveler has no record - no cryptographic proof
- **Car rental damage fraud:** Rental company claims pre-existing damage was caused by renter - renter has no tamper-evident pre-rental inspection
- **Fake frequent flyer statements:** Miles brokers create fake statements to "prove" account balances when selling miles
- **Resort fee hiding:** Hotels don't disclose mandatory resort fees until checkout - no verifiable pre-booking disclosure
- **Travel voucher double-redemption:** Travelers redeem same voucher multiple times by altering voucher code/amount
- **Baggage claim inflation:** Passengers inflate baggage claim amounts by altering airline settlement letters

**Regulatory frameworks:**

- **Airlines:** EU261 (flight delay/cancellation compensation), Montreal Convention (baggage liability), DOT consumer protection (USA)
- **Hotels:** FTC disclosure requirements (resort fees, taxes), ADA compliance, consumer protection laws
- **Car rentals:** Consumer protection laws, liability insurance requirements, damage disclosure requirements
- **Travel insurance:** State insurance regulation, NAIC travel insurance model act, Solvency II (EU)
- **Travel agencies:** IATA (International Air Transport Association) accreditation, ASTA (American Society of Travel Advisors), consumer protection bonds
- **Cruise lines:** Athens Convention (maritime passenger liability), SOLAS (ship safety), port state control

### Gambling & Betting

**⚠️ JURISDICTIONAL CAVEAT:** OCR-to-hash only works where regulators enforce strict record retention with severe penalties for tampering (license revocation, criminal charges). In weakly-regulated jurisdictions, operators can delete bet records freely—OCR-to-hash provides **no protection**.

**Tier 1 (Strong):** UK (UKGC), Nevada/New Jersey (USA), Malta (MGA), Gibraltar, Isle of Man
**Tier 2 (Moderate):** Curacao, Antigua, Kahnawake—lighter enforcement, limited protection
**Tier 3 (No Protection):** Costa Rica, Vanuatu, Belize, Panama, unregulated offshore—operators can delete records at will

**Alternatives that work:** (1) Peer-to-peer betting with independent third-party escrow maintaining hash database, or (2) Blockchain-based betting (Augur, Polymarket) with immutable on-chain records.

Prevents either party claiming "bet was different". Requires trusted escrow service. Blockchain-based escrow ideal (Augur, Polymarket). Domain binding verifies escrow.    |

**Why gambling documents need special treatment:**

1. **Operator incentive to delete:** Unlike receipts (merchant already paid) or licenses (authority has no skin in game), gambling operators have direct financial incentive to delete winning bet records
2. **Weak enforcement in many jurisdictions:** Gambling is legal but self-regulated in many places - no government agency will force operators to honor bets
3. **Offshore regulatory arbitrage:** Online gambling operators intentionally choose Tier 3 jurisdictions to avoid accountability
4. **You cannot sue an offshore shell company:** Curacao/Costa Rica gambling operators are often shell companies - impossible to pursue legal action
5. **Blockchain provides better solution:** Immutable on-chain bet records (Augur, Polymarket) solve deletion problem - no central operator controls database

**When OCR-to-hash actually works for gambling:**

✅ **Government-run lotteries:** State enforcement, criminal penalties for tampering (though most already use cryptographic validation)
✅ **Tier 1 regulated jurisdictions:** UKGC, Nevada Gaming Control, NJ Division of Gaming Enforcement - operators face license loss/criminal charges for deleting records
✅ **Third-party escrow with blockchain:** Independent escrow maintains hash database or records on public blockchain
✅ **Peer-to-peer betting with trusted clearinghouse:** Neither party controls hash database

**When OCR-to-hash provides NO protection:**

❌ **Tier 3 "you're on your own" jurisdictions:** Costa Rica, Vanuatu, Belize, unregulated offshore operators - can delete bet records freely
❌ **Underground/illegal gambling:** No legal recourse whatsoever
❌ **Self-regulated online casinos:** Operator controls both the game and the hash database - can delete at will

**Recommendation for bettors:**

- **Only use Tier 1 regulated operators** if relying on OCR-to-hash verification (UK Gambling Commission, Nevada casinos, New Jersey online gambling)
- **For online betting, consider blockchain-based platforms** (Augur, Polymarket) where bet records are immutable
- **Avoid Tier 3 jurisdictions entirely** unless you trust the operator's reputation (but even then, no legal recourse if they welch)
- **For peer-to-peer bets, use third-party escrow** with OCR-to-hash verification maintained by escrow service, not either bettor

**Real-world fraud examples:**

- **Offshore sportsbook selective scamming:** Player wins $50K parlay, offshore sportsbook (Curacao license) claims "bet was never placed" or "account violated terms" - no recourse
- **Altered betting slip fraud (bettor side):** Bettor claims they bet on winner, but actually bet on loser - attempts to cash forged slip (OCR-to-hash prevents this in Tier 1 jurisdictions)
- **Casino TITO fraud:** Fake slot machine vouchers printed - casinos refuse to honor (OCR-to-hash in Nevada prevents this via domain binding to casino TITO system)
- **Online casino account disputes:** Casino claims player "never deposited" or "withdrew already" - disputes impossible to resolve in unregulated jurisdictions
- **Fantasy sports contest deletion:** DFS operator deletes high-winning contest entries, claims "you didn't enter" when player wins $10K+ (OCR-to-hash works only in NY/regulated DFS states)

**Regulatory frameworks:**

- **Tier 1 (Strong):** UK Gambling Commission (UKGC), Nevada Gaming Control Board, New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement, Malta Gaming Authority (MGA), Gibraltar Gambling Commissioner
- **Tier 2 (Moderate):** Curacao eGaming, Kahnawake Gaming Commission, Antigua Directorate of Offshore Gaming
- **Tier 3 (Minimal/None):** Costa Rica (no regulation), Vanuatu, Belize, Panama, many offshore jurisdictions
- **Blockchain betting:** Decentralized platforms (Augur, Polymarket) with on-chain bet records - no central regulator needed (cryptographic enforcement)

### Adaptations and questions

- **Different registration marks** - corners, edges, watermarks, ot none just proximity to `verify:` ?
- **Different hash algorithms** SHA-256 seems OK for 2025, but is a shorter one fine really? Or longer like SHA-512 or BLAKE3
- **Blockchain anchoring** Ethereum, Hedera, IOTA - does this need byzantine distributed consensus before a hash is recorded in public? 
- **Timestamp verification** Superficially, a nation state could persuade a university to back create a "Jason Bourne" MIT maths grad entry and nothing would stop them. 
- **Multi-signature** Multiple organizations could attest to something, but I can't think what that would be for.
- **Merkle tree aggregation** Batch verification of entire sets of hashes, but that might not be needed.
- **QR codes** containing hashes or verification URLs - in addition to the plain text that can be normalized and then hash verified? Maybe but why?
- **Microprinting** for forgery resistance if that's unique for each item of the production line. A QR code would do, especially if tiny.
- **Grace periods** or expiration dates - the latter should be in the text to-be-hashed. If something is cancelled ahead of schedule that should be in the response: "CANCELED on mm/dd/yy" 
- **Witness signatures** and countersignatures - digital rather than a squiggle. Maybe not, that's better for a larger blockchain solution.

### Technical Variations Disclosed

- **URL-based verification** Hash in URL path, query parameter, or fragment or a replacement var: verify:hello.com/{hash}.txt
- **HTTP-based validation** 200/404/302 status, JSON responses, XML responses?
- **Client-side verification** Built into browsers or a plugin/extension for them? A real mobile or desktop app?
- **Email attachments** with embedded verification in Thunderbird, etc?
- **Server-side verification** API endpoints microservices instead of client-side prep and a GET of a hash toward "OK"
- **PDF annotations** with verification metadata - our training pages are HTML which is a real deployment case. but PDF would need techniques too.
- **Image steganography** for hidden hashable test - could as easily be somethine else as the payload is for machine not human eyes. 

### Future Anticipated Uses

- **Supply chain finance** documents
- **Trade documents** and letters of credit
- **Customs bonds** and guarantees
- **Cross-border** e-commerce receipts

## Tech Stack

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### What makes this better than QR codes?

**Human readability** - QR codes hide information; OCR-to-hash keeps text readable for humans. An interviewer can read "Edinburgh University First Class Honours" on your CV, then verify it cryptographically if needed. QR codes make you choose between machine-readable OR human-readable. OCR-to-hash gives you both.

**Privacy** - QR codes either (a) encode all data publicly, or (b) link to databases anyone can scrape. OCR-to-hash only reveals the hash when someone physically scans the document.

**Professional appearance** - A CV with 5-10 verifiable claims would need 5-10 QR codes (visual clutter). OCR-to-hash adds just one small `verify:` URL per claim.

See the full [QR Code comparison](#decision-criteria-ocr-to-hash-vs-qr-code) for details.

### Why client-side? Why not use cloud OCR APIs?

**Privacy.** Cloud OCR services expose your sensitive documents to third-party servers. See [Privacy-First Architecture](#privacy-first-architecture-why-client-side-ocr-matters) for complete details on why images never leave your phone.

### Will this work with ornate degree certificates?

**Not yet.** Current OCR struggles with decorative fonts, seals, and embossing on traditional university diplomas. See [OCR Limitations](#ocr-limitations-what-works-today-vs-future-needs) for complete details on current limitations and future solutions including short-form claims, on-device AI (2026+), and manual text entry options.

### How does this prevent fake receipts/degrees/licenses?

**Cryptographic hash** - Any change to the text (even one character) completely changes the SHA-256 hash. The verification endpoint will return 404 (not found) instead of 200 OK. See [Technical_Concepts.md: Hash Algorithms](Technical_Concepts.md#hash-algorithms).

**Domain binding** - The `verify:` URL specifies which organization to trust. A fake degree from `fake-university.com` won't verify against `degrees.ed.ac.uk`. Users see "VERIFIED by degrees.ed.ac.uk" not just a green checkmark. See [Technical_Concepts.md: Domain Binding](Technical_Concepts.md#domain-binding-text-determines-verification-authority).

**No hash on document** - The hash isn't printed, so you can't just photoshop the receipt and compute a new hash. You'd need to compromise the issuing organization's verification database.

### Can I verify documents without internet?

**Partially.** OCR happens 100% offline on your phone. But the final hash lookup (`https://example.com/hashes/abc123...`) requires network access to check if the hash is valid.

Future enhancement: Organizations could publish signed hash databases that you download periodically for offline verification (airline mode, remote locations, etc.).

### What about blockchain? Is this using blockchain?

**No.** OCR-to-hash uses simple HTTPS verification endpoints - just static files or serverless functions. No blockchain, no cryptocurrency, no distributed consensus.

**Why not blockchain?**
- Universities/organizations already have trusted domains (e.g., `degrees.ed.ac.uk`)
- HTTP 200/404 responses are simpler than blockchain queries
- Marginal cost is ~$0.000005 per verification (vs blockchain transaction fees)
- Faster (milliseconds vs seconds/minutes for blockchain confirmation)

Blockchain adds complexity without solving a real problem here. The trust anchor is the organization's domain name (backed by DNS/HTTPS infrastructure), not a blockchain.

### What about existing verification technologies? What's novel here?

**Prior art comparison:**

While various technologies verify documents, OCR-to-hash combines elements in a novel way:

- **Estonia's KSI blockchain** - Verifies digital documents in databases, not OCR from printed physical documents. Documents are born-digital in government systems.
- **QR codes** - Encode data (opaque to humans), don't use human-readable text as the verification input. Can't read/audit what you're verifying.
- **Blockchain timestamping** - Documents are digital files, not OCR'd from paper. Requires on-chain transactions and fees.
- **Standard document hashing** - Hashes digital PDFs/files, doesn't include the physical-to-digital OCR bridge or the `verify:` scheme.
- **Cloud OCR verification services** - Require uploading sensitive documents to third parties (privacy violation). Vendor lock-in.

**What makes OCR-to-hash different:**

The complete system integration is novel:
1. **Registration marks** → Computer vision detects document boundaries on printed paper
2. **OCR** → Extract human-readable text from physical documents (Tesseract.js client-side)
3. **Normalization** → Apply consistent text cleanup rules (space removal, etc.)
4. **Hash** → Compute SHA-256 from normalized text
5. **`verify:domain.com/path` scheme** → Human-readable pseudo-URL that indicates verification authority
6. **HTTP verification** → Simple 200/404 response (no blockchain, no fees)

This bridges the physical-to-digital gap while maintaining human readability and privacy. The `verify:` scheme is particularly important - it's visible on the printed document, readable by humans ("verified by edinburgh.ac.uk"), and parsable by software.

**No single prior art system does all of this** - especially the OCR bridge from printed physical documents with human-readable verification paths.

### Is this free to use?

**For verifiers:** Yes, the client-side app is free and open source (AGPL-3.0).

**For issuers:** Organizations decide whether to charge for verification lookups. Infrastructure cost is ~$0.000005 per verification (Cloudflare Workers example). Many universities/governments offer free verification as part of their mission. Commercial entities may charge. See [Verification_Charges.md](Verification_Charges.md) for detailed business models.

### Can organizations revoke credentials?

**Yes.** Instead of returning "OK", the verification endpoint can return "REVOKED" or "SUSPENDED". The app shows ❌ red "REVOKED by xyz.org" instead of green "VERIFIED". See [Technical_Concepts.md: Response Formats](Technical_Concepts.md#response-formats) for all status codes.

Medical licenses, professional certifications, security clearances - anything that can be revoked can use this status. See [Use_Cases/Medical_License.md](Use_Cases/Medical_License.md).

### What if I lose the physical document?

**Depends on the use case:**

- **Receipt verification** - You need the physical receipt text to compute the hash. If you lose it, you can't verify. (This is a feature - prevents someone finding a hash and claiming your receipt.)
- **Degree verification** - Universities can offer a portal where graduates log in and retrieve the normalized text + verification URL. You can regenerate the claim for your CV even if you lose the ornate certificate.
- **Medical licenses** - Regulatory bodies can provide license holders access to the normalized text.

The hash itself is useless without knowing what text to hash. Security through obscurity? No - security through requiring physical possession of the document (or authorized access to the issuer's portal).

### How do I create verifiable documents for my organization?

See [For Organizations Creating Verifiable Documents](#for-organizations-creating-verifiable-documents) for complete implementation guide.

**Quick overview:**
1. Generate certification text
2. Normalize it (see [NORMALIZATION.md](NORMALIZATION.md) and [Technical_Concepts.md: Text Normalization](Technical_Concepts.md#text-normalization))
3. Compute SHA-256 hash (see [Technical_Concepts.md: Hash Algorithms](Technical_Concepts.md#hash-algorithms))
4. Print text + `verify:your-org.com/c` with registration marks (see [Technical_Concepts.md: Registration Marks](Technical_Concepts.md#registration-marks-computer-vision-for-document-boundaries))
5. Host static file at `https://your-org.com/c/{HASH}` returning "OK" (see [Technical_Concepts.md: Response Formats](Technical_Concepts.md#response-formats))

Infrastructure cost: ~$5 per million verifications (Cloudflare example).

### Does this work internationally?

**Yes.** The system is designed for global use:

- **Unicode text** - Supports any language (Chinese, Arabic, Cyrillic, etc.)
- **International domains** - Works with .uk, .de, .com.br, etc.
- **Public Suffix List** - Correctly identifies domain authority across global TLDs
- **No central authority** - Each organization runs their own verification endpoint

However, OCR accuracy may vary by language. Tesseract.js supports 100+ languages, but on-device AI models (2026+) will be even better.

Emerging/Scaling

- Hash anchoring (public/managed): Independent timestamping and tamper evidence at scale by anchoring Merkle roots or event digests to durable ledgers.
- Guardtime KSI (Keyless Signature Infrastructure): https://guardtime.com/
  - National-scale deployments and government endorsements (e.g., Estonia); high-assurance integrity for records.

### Versus OCR-to-hash

Where OCR-to-hash fits
- Human-readable, issuer-controlled, zero PII leakage (hash only), web-native, low-cost (static hosting), works with print flows, no keys for end users.

Best-of-both hybrids
- OCR-to-hash + timestamp anchoring (RFC 3161 or blockchain Merkle roots) for independent time/immutability.
- OCR-to-hash + verifiable credentials for cryptographic signatures alongside human-friendly print.
- OCR-to-hash + QR/NFC for speed while retaining a human-verifiable pathway.

When to choose what
- High legal weight/non-repudiation: Use digital signatures (PAdES) and/or VCs; add OCR-to-hash for human inspection and offline fallback.
- High-volume scanning/operations: Use QR/barcodes; add OCR-to-hash to keep a human-verifiable pathway and reduce redirect spoofing.
- Field verification with privacy: OCR-to-hash shines—no PII transmission, works with phone camera, issuer hosts a simple “OK/REVOKED” endpoint.
- Anti-clone physical goods: NFC-secured labels or serialized barcodes; optionally pair with printed OCR-to-hash declarations for paperwork.
