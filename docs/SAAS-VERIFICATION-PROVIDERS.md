# SaaS Verification Providers

## The Opportunity

OCR-to-hash verification requires someone to operate a verification endpoint at a trusted domain. Large organizations (banks, governments, corporations) can host their own, but vast categories of issuers cannot:

- Individuals (freelancers, landlords, private sellers)
- Small businesses without IT resources
- Civic organizations (HOAs, clubs, societies, churches)
- Local government bodies (town councils, school boards)
- Professional practitioners (solo attorneys, accountants, doctors)

This creates an opportunity for **SaaS verification providers** - companies that host verification endpoints on behalf of issuers who lack their own infrastructure.

## White-Label Domain Model

The simplest approach: issuers use the provider's domain directly.

```
verify:witnessco.com/v/abc123
verify:docuverify.io/hash/7f3a2b...
verify:certchain.com/c/acme-corp/8847
```

This works but has a trust limitation: verifiers must trust both the SaaS provider AND the issuer. The provider's domain becomes the trust anchor, not the issuer's.

## Custom Domain Model (Recommended)

Better: providers offer custom domain support so issuers appear under their own identity.

```
verify:contracts.acme-corp.com/v/8847
verify:hr.smallbiz.com/references/4421
verify:records.oakstreet-hoa.org/minutes/2026-01
```

The issuer controls the domain (via DNS CNAME or similar), the provider operates the infrastructure. Verifiers see the issuer's domain as the trust anchor.

**Implementation:**
- Issuer registers domain or subdomain
- Points DNS to provider's infrastructure
- Provider handles SSL certificates (Let's Encrypt, etc.)
- Provider hosts hash database on issuer's behalf
- Issuer manages their hashes via provider's dashboard/API

## Multi-Tenant Architecture

Providers serve many issuers from shared infrastructure:

## Business Models

**Subscription Tiers:**
- Free: Limited hashes, provider subdomain only
- Basic: Custom domain, moderate volume
- Professional: Higher volume, API access, analytics
- Enterprise: Unlimited, SLA, dedicated support

**Free Tier Economics:**

Many small issuers (HOAs, solo practitioners, landlords) may only need a few dozen hashes and receive a handful of verifications per month. At ~$0.000005 per verification, the infrastructure cost is negligible. Providers can offer genuinely free tiers for low-volume users:
- Goodwill and ecosystem growth
- Upsell path when volumes increase
- Network effects (more issuers = more verifier awareness)

The threshold for "free" can be generous—even 1,000 verifications/month costs under $0.01.

**Per-Document:**
- Pay-per-hash for occasional users
- Bulk pricing for high-volume periods
- Event-based (e.g., annual meeting minutes)

**White-Label Resale:**
- Law firms offering to clients
- Accountants for business clients
- HR platforms for employee documents
- Property management for landlords

**API Integration:**
- Contract management platforms
- HRIS systems
- Document management systems
- Legal practice software

## Post-Verification Actions (Value-Add)

Beyond simple OK/REVOKED responses, SaaS providers can offer **post-verification actions** - follow-up workflows triggered after successful verification. This differentiates providers and creates additional revenue streams.

**Action Types:**

| Action Type | Description | Example Use Cases |
|-------------|-------------|-------------------|
| POST form | Verifier submits structured feedback | Building inspectors, healthcare workers, tour guides |
| Link to profile | Response includes URL to public registry | Attorneys (bar profile), professional licenses |
| Complaint pathway | One-click link to file concerns | Police credentials, licensed professionals |
| Contact info | Broker/agent contact for follow-up | Insurance certificates, B2B contracts |
| Tip/payment link | Digital gratuity without cash | Tour guides, service workers |

**Concrete Examples:**

- **Building Inspector Badges** — Homeowner records visit details (address, time, concerns); creates audit trail; bribery deterrent. "Never discouraged" principle: every report logged.
- **Healthcare Worker Credentials** — Patient/family records interaction; write-only from their POV; workers benefit from logged interactions as staffing evidence.
- **Tour Guide Verification** — POST feedback form plus tip link for digital gratuity; valuable when local currency unfamiliar or ATMs scarce.
- **Attorney Good Standing** — Link to bar association profile with disciplinary history, CLE status, and existing complaint channels.
- **Commercial Insurance Certificates** — Broker contact and link to request updated certificate; identifies specific lapsed coverage segments.
- **Building Safety Postings** — Link to inspection history (elevator, restaurant health grades, pool certifications). Patterns matter as much as current status—seeing 10 consecutive on-time inspections tells a different story than a single OK.

**External Redirects:**

Post-verification actions don't need to stay within the issuer's infrastructure. The response can include a redirect (or link) to an **external site with context**:

```
HTTP 200 OK
Status: OK
More: https://cityofchicago.gov/elevator-inspections?building=1234&unit=5
```

The issuer provides the context parameters; the external site (city portal, regulatory database, professional registry) handles the display. This avoids duplicating public infrastructure while still giving verifiers a seamless path to deeper information.

**Provider Infrastructure:**

To support post-verification actions, providers need:
- Form builder for issuer-defined POST schemas
- Secure submission storage with issuer-only access
- Optional webhook delivery of submissions
- Rate limiting and abuse detection
- GDPR/privacy compliance for submitted data

**Revenue Opportunity:**

Post-verification actions justify premium pricing:
- Basic tier: OK/REVOKED only
- Professional tier: Link-based actions
- Enterprise tier: POST forms with analytics dashboard

## Trust Considerations

**Provider Reputation:**
Verifiers must trust that the provider:
- Won't fabricate hashes
- Won't delete hashes improperly
- Maintains uptime and availability
- Preserves records for required retention periods

**Issuer Accountability:**
Even with custom domains, the issuer remains accountable for:
- What documents they hash
- Accuracy of document content
- Proper revocation when needed

**Audit Trails:**
Providers should maintain:
- Hash submission timestamps
- Revocation history
- Access logs (who verified what, when)
- Issuer authentication records

## Regulatory Considerations

Some industries may require:
- Data residency (hashes stored in specific jurisdictions)
- Retention guarantees (minimum years before deletion)
- Audit access for regulators
- Escrow arrangements for provider failure

Providers serving regulated industries (healthcare, finance, legal) should document compliance capabilities.

## Competitive Landscape

This space is nascent. Potential entrants include:
- Existing e-signature platforms (DocuSign, Adobe Sign)
- Notary platforms (Notarize, NotaryCam)
- Legal tech companies
- Blockchain/timestamping services pivoting to simpler models
- New startups purpose-built for OCR-to-hash

The key differentiator will be **simplicity** - making it trivially easy for a sole proprietor or small organization to get verification endpoints operational.

## Getting Started (For Providers)

1. **Core Infrastructure:**
   - Hash database (simple key-value, or append-only log)
   - HTTP endpoint returning status for hash lookups
   - SSL/TLS termination with custom domain support

2. **Issuer Onboarding:**
   - Self-service signup
   - Domain verification (DNS TXT record)
   - Dashboard for hash management

3. **Developer Experience:**
   - API for programmatic hash submission
   - Webhooks for verification events
   - SDKs for common languages/platforms

4. **Trust Building:**
   - Transparency reports
   - Third-party audits
   - Published uptime and retention commitments
