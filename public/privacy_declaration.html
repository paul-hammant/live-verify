            <strong>TL;DR:</strong> For this prototype, Live Verify runs entirely in your browser—OCR, normalization, and hashing stay on-device. During verification, the only network calls are minimal HTTP GET requests to check hashes against certification servers (plus the initial download of the JS libraries listed below).<br><br>We expect the same multi-step flow to be embedded directly into iOS and Android camera apps (alongside Live Text / Camera Text) with the same on-device privacy posture.

	            <h2>What Live Verify Does</h2>
	            <p>
	                For now, Live Verify is a proof-of-concept browser-based application that scans text within registration marks, computes a cryptographic hash,
	                and verifies it against a certification server. The entire OCR and hashing process happens <strong>locally in your browser</strong>. Over time, the same
	                multi-step flow could be embedded directly into iOS and Android camera apps.
	            </p>
	            <div class="warning">
	                <strong>Future native camera apps:</strong> iOS and Android would likely use platform OCR and image processing rather than browser-based
	                Tesseract/OpenCV. The steps stay the same (OCR → normalize → SHA‑256 → GET hash), but should be faster and more reliable—while keeping the same
	                on-device privacy posture.
	            </div>
	        </div>

	        <div class="section">
	            <h2>Data Processing: 100% Local</h2>
	            <p>In this demo / proof-of-concept, all sensitive operations occur entirely within your browser. When these same multi-step features land directly in iOS and Android camera apps, the privacy model should remain the same: on-device and private.</p>
	            <ul>
	                <li><strong>Camera access:</strong> Uses browser MediaStream API - you tap to take a picture, which is not saved to your photos and discarded soon after</li>
	                <li><strong>OCR text extraction:</strong> Performed locally using <a href="https://github.com/tesseract-ocr" target="_blank">Tesseract OCR</a> (open source)</li>
	                <li><strong>Image processing:</strong> <a href="https://opencv.org/" target="_blank">OpenCV</a> (open source) snips out a rectangle from a larger image - entirely in the browser</li>
	                <li><strong>Text normalization:</strong> Character mapping happens in the browser page (JavaScript in the web page)</li>
	                <li><strong>SHA-256 hashing:</strong> Computed locally using browser's built-in <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SubtleCrypto" target="_blank">SubtleCrypto API</a></li>
	            </ul>
	            <p>
	                <strong>Future native camera apps:</strong> When this verification flow is embedded into iOS and Android camera apps, the underlying implementation will likely use
	                platform OCR and image processing (not browser-based Tesseract/OpenCV). The steps stay the same (OCR → normalize → SHA‑256 → GET hash), but should be faster and
	                more reliable—while keeping the same on-device privacy posture.

	                <strong>Summary:</strong> Your document images and extracted text never leave your device to complete verification. They are not uploaded to any cloud OCR service and are not transmitted to certification servers.
	                <div style="margin-top: 10px;">
	                    Note: the person holding the document is still trusting the verifier (the person using the app) to handle any local copies responsibly. A production deployment could be configured to retain some details locally (or in an approved system) if authorized and legally required.

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Verifier roles, logging, and retention</h2>
            <p>Verification involves two distinct roles:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Document holder:</strong> The person presenting the claim. e.g., an ID card or printed (or on screen) credential.</li>
                <li><strong>Verifier/operator:</strong> The person using an OCR-to-hash app to check it (e.g., a door-person, hotel clerk, employer, bank clerk, law enforcement and many more). The operator is going to hand the ID or printed item back to the document holder after processing it.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                This prototype is designed to verify without sending document images or plain text off-device. However, a verifier may still have operational and legal obligations
                about what they do with the information that becomes visible during verification.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Example (nightclub door-person):</strong> An authorized ID-checking app might log the person’s name, ID number, age-check outcome, and entry timestamp to support safety and incident investigation.</li>
	                <li><strong>Example (law enforcement):</strong> Officers may have access to deeper government systems (e.g., DMV/immigration databases) for in-depth checks beyond what a public hash lookup can provide; logging and retention may be longer, governed by local policy and statute.</li>
                <li><strong>Retention:</strong> Some deployments may purge such logs after a year; financially important or regulated contexts may retain longer.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                It’s also worth noting that parts of the developing world are moving toward fully electronic IDs. In those contexts, a phone tap plus NFC-based ID exchange may become the primary flow,
                and can be faster than OCR. OCR-to-hash can remain a privacy-preserving fallback for printed documents, screenshots, or situations where NFC is unavailable.
            </p>
            <p>
                These retention choices are about verifier policy and legal compliance—not about the hash verification protocol. The protocol minimizes what needs to be transmitted,
                but it cannot remove the verifier’s responsibility to handle any locally visible or stored data appropriately.
            </p>

                <strong>Important:</strong> The SHA-256 hash sent during verification is a cryptographic one-way function. It is mathematically infeasible to reverse-engineer the original document text from the hash. The hash alone reveals nothing about your document's content.

                <a href="one-way-hash.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one-way-hash.html</a>. At the same time, issuers obviously remain responsible for protecting the plain text documents that underlie those hashes—think PCI-class data separation, strict access control, and logging—so that anyone who could reverse the process still needs the same level of controls you'd expect for any sensitive record.

            <h2>Verification Server Privacy</h2>
            <p>When you scan a document, Live Verify connects to the domain specified in the document's verification URL (e.g., <code>verify:example.com/path</code>). The privacy practices of that certification server are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Not controlled by Live Verify</strong> - Each organization runs their own server</li>
                <li><strong>May log HTTP requests</strong> - Standard web server behavior (IP address, timestamp, user agent)</li>
                <li><strong>Receive only the hash</strong> - No document content is ever transmitted</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Even though only a hash is sent, logging can still create privacy risk: if a national authority (or any operator) controls or monitors the verification domain, it could log hash lookups and infer that your ID was likely presented to a particular verifier at a particular time—e.g., a hotel chain that serves Nepalese cities and tourist locations—and therefore that you are likely (or that someone using a stolen copy of your ID) in Nepal.
                This is not a weakness in hashing; it’s ordinary web request metadata. If that risk matters in your context, issuers can mitigate it with careful server-side logging policies, legal controls, and—where appropriate—privacy-preserving proxying or aggregation.
            </p>
            <p>For questions about a specific verification server's privacy practices, contact the organization that issued the document.</p>

            <h2>Security Considerations</h2>
            <p>While Live Verify protects your privacy, users should be aware:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>HTTPS required:</strong> Verification URLs are automatically upgraded to HTTPS to prevent interception</li>
                <li><strong>No server-side trust:</strong> Live Verify trusts the certification server specified in the document URL</li>
                <li><strong>Client-side only:</strong> Security depends on your browser's integrity and isolation</li>
            </ul>
