## What is an Anti-Coercion Canary?

A **canary** is a signal whose *absence* indicates a problem. Coal miners used canaries; if the bird stopped singing, there was danger. Digital canaries work the same way—regular signals that, if they stop, indicate something is wrong.

**Anti-coercion canaries** prove someone is acting freely. If the expected signal doesn't appear, or appears with specific variations, it indicates duress.

## Why Canaries Matter

**Gag Orders:** Legal orders can prevent companies from disclosing surveillance. They usually can't compel false statements. Removing a canary (stopping the "no surveillance" statement) signals without violating the order.

**Personal Safety:** Travelers, journalists, activists in dangerous situations need ways to signal distress even when monitored.

**Coerced Signatures:** Elder abuse, undue influence, and duress can force signatures. Pre-registered safe phrases prove voluntary action.

**Editorial Independence:** Research organizations, media outlets, and analysts need to prove they weren't pressured.

## Data Verified

Issuing entity/person, canary statement (what is being attested), timestamp, expected update schedule, any variations from normal pattern.

**Document Types:**
- **Warrant Canary:** No government orders received
- **Safe Signal:** Personal check-in confirming safety
- **Independence Attestation:** No editorial/analytical interference
- **Voluntary Signature:** Contract signed without coercion
- **Journalist Safety Check:** Field reporter status
- **Dead Man's Switch:** Automated actions if check-in missed

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain and current status.

**Status Indications:**
- **Active** — Canary current and on schedule
- **Overdue** — Expected update not received (WARNING)
- **Removed** — Canary statement no longer present (WARNING)
- **Modified** — Statement changed from previous version (WARNING)
- **Verified Safe Phrase** — Correct pre-registered phrase used
- **Unknown Phrase** — Phrase doesn't match pre-registered (ALERT)

## Second-Party Use

The **Issuer** benefits from verification.

**Legal Protection:** Canary removal isn't lying—it's stopping a voluntary statement.

**Signal Without Speaking:** When you can't say "we received an order," you can stop saying "we haven't."

**Proof of Patterns:** Historical canary record shows when changes occurred.

## Third-Party Use

**Users / Customers**
**Service Trust:** Monitor warrant canaries of services you use.

**Emergency Contacts**
**Safety Monitoring:** Receive alerts if expected check-ins are missed.

**Legal Observers**
**Pattern Analysis:** Track which organizations stop publishing canaries.

**Researchers**
**Transparency Metrics:** Study canary practices across industries.

## Verification Architecture

**The Absence Signal**

Canaries work by *removal*, not addition. The system must track:
- Expected update schedule
- Last verified update
- Whether current period's canary exists

Verification of "canary not present" is meaningful.

**Pre-Registration for Duress Codes**

For personal safety signals:
1. User registers safe phrase in advance
2. Check-in includes the phrase
3. Verification confirms phrase matches
4. Wrong phrase triggers alert

Coercers don't know the pre-registered phrase.

**Graduated Signals**

Some systems use graduated warnings:
- Full statement: All clear
- Partial statement: Some issues (specific ones removed)
- Missing statement: Serious issues
- Modified statement: Check what changed

**Historical Record**

Verification includes history:
- "Canary present since 2020"
- "First absence: January 2026"
- "Statement modified on X date"

Pattern changes are informative.

## Legal Considerations

Warrant canaries exist in legal gray area:
- Can government compel continued publication? (Probably not—compelled speech issues)
- Does removal violate gag order? (Probably not—it's not disclosure)
- Is this "constructive disclosure"? (Untested in most jurisdictions)

Organizations should seek legal advice. The verification system is neutral—it just records what's published.

## Novel Applications

**Automated Monitoring**
Subscribe to canary feeds; receive alerts on any status change.

**Composite Canaries**
Industry-wide canary aggregation: "Of 500 VPN providers, 3 have removed canaries this quarter."

**Personal Safety Networks**
Groups where members monitor each other's check-ins.

**Research Integrity**
Academic journals publishing "no retractions due to pressure" canaries.


## Jurisdictional Witnessing

A jurisdiction may require the issuer to retain a **witnessing firm** for regulatory compliance. The witnessing firm:

- Receives all hashes from the issuer, and any subsequent changes to the payload as they happen—which may manifest as a new hash, a status change, or even a 404 (record deleted)
- Receives structured content/metadata (key identifiers and dates)
- Does **NOT** receive plaintext or sensitive personal information
- Provides an immutable, timestamped audit trail—available to the jurisdiction on demand, to document holders/third parties during disputes, or as expert witness testimony in legal proceedings

This provides:
- **Non-repudiation:** Issuer cannot deny issuing the document
- **Timestamp proof:** Document existed at a specific time
- **Regulatory audit:** Jurisdictions can inspect the witness ledger for fraud detection
- **Resilience:** Verification works even if issuer's systems go down

**Public Blockchain (Non-Party)**

Witnessing firms may periodically commit rollups to an inexpensive public blockchain, providing an ultimate immutability guarantee. The blockchain is a "non-party"—infrastructure, not a participant in the transaction. This creates multiple verification paths:

1. **Issuer domain** — Direct check against the issuer
2. **Witnessing firm** — Independent confirmation with timestamp
3. **Public blockchain** — Decentralized trust anchor via rollup inclusion
