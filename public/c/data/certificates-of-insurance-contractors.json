    "rationale": "Prevents fake certificates of insurance which are extremely common fraud. Domain binding verifies insurer. Real-time verification by certificate holder before allowing contractor work. Short COI lifetime (project duration). COI fraud enables uninsured contractor liability exposure for project owners. Critical for construction and commercial contracts where COI verification is standard practice."
