    "rationale": "SUPERSEDED status critical for updated wills - prevents execution of outdated wills. Prevents forgery of testamentary documents. Estate disputes require verifiable will authenticity. Human-readable format essential for legal interpretation. Multi-page wills benefit from per-page hash verification to prevent page substitution attacks. Witness signature blocks particularly benefit from OCR-to-hash verification. Domain binding to attorney or court ensures authenticity."
