    "dataVisibleAfterVerification": "Officer status (active/verified). Real-time verification shows officer photo, badge number, agency affiliation, credential number. Link to government agency system. This is for unexpected enforcement encounters, NOT official airport/port-of-entry immigration where context makes officer legitimacy clear",
    "rationale": "Person verifies immigration officer credentials at internal checkpoints (100-mile border zone - affects 2/3 of US population), ICE home visits, workplace raids, or plainclothes officer encounters. Domain binding verifies government agency (cbp.gov, ice.gov, border-agency.gov). Prevents fake immigration officer extortion scams (criminals impersonating ICE/CBP to extort money from immigrants, threaten deportation unless 'fines' paid). Critical for immigrant communities targeted by fraud. Enhances accountability for legitimate immigration enforcement."
