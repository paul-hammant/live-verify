Trust Model,Who operates the verification tool?,"employment-references.md, university-degrees.md, bank-statements.md, alarm-installer-monitoring-licenses.md, additional-driver-endorsements.md, advance-parole-reentry-permits.md, biometric-likeness-claims.md, authorized-agent-confirmations.md, building-inspector-verification.md, cold-caller-credentials.md, childcare-provider-verification.md, contractor-licensing-bonding.md, construction-site-permits.md, concealed-carry-permits.md, contract-signing-authority.md, contracts-agreements-multipage.md, delivery-courier-verification.md, delivery-orders-cargo-release.md, estate-clearance-authorizations.md, food-hygiene-postings.md","Clarify if the 'Live Verification' is intended for the Subject (2nd Party) to show or the Verifier (3rd Party) to perform. If 2nd Party, how does 3rd Party trust the device? If 3rd Party, emphasize they need the text/document."
Privacy,Issuer Tracking of Verification,"employment-references.md, university-degrees.md, bank-statements.md, advance-healthcare-directives.md, adoption-custody-orders.md, anti-coercion-canaries.md, 1031-exchange-documentation.md, biometric-appointment-confirmations.md, beneficial-ownership-declarations.md, birth-death-certificates.md, bnpl-purchase-agreements.md, census-forms-surveys.md, capital-adequacy-attestations.md, consent-records.md, compensation-conflict-disclosures.md, consular-processing-appointments.md, criminal-background-check-results.md, cyber-extortion-ransomware.md, credit-card-travel-benefits.md, discharge-summaries-care-plans.md, drug-testing-anti-doping.md, employment-authorization-ead.md, ethical-approval-irb-iacuc.md, fingerprint-certifications.md","The Issuer (1st Party) receives the hash and knows exactly *which* document is being verified. They can build a graph of 'who (IP) checks what (Hash) when'. Address if this metadata leakage is acceptable or if using a Witnessing Firm/Anonymizer is required."
Privacy,Verifier Data Access,"employment-references.md, university-degrees.md, bank-statements.md, advance-healthcare-directives.md, account-aggregation-authorization.md, affidavits-sworn-statements.md, blood-type-donor-cards.md, audit-reports-financial-statements.md, clinical-trial-documents.md, commercial-invoices-customs.md, commercial-insurance-policy-documents.md, cruise-final-folios.md, conviction-expungement-certificates.md, driving-records.md, disability-benefit-calculations.md, financial-promotions-sign-offs.md","The Verifier (3rd Party) *must* possess the plaintext to generate the hash. The 'privacy' benefit is only that the Issuer doesn't receive the plaintext *back* during verification. Clarify that the Subject still reveals sensitive data to the Verifier."
Security,Low Entropy / Brute Force,"employment-references.md, 1031-exchange-documentation.md, aggregate-deductible-retrospective.md, annuity-pricing-certifications.md, blood-type-donor-cards.md, ballot-chain-of-custody.md, census-forms-surveys.md, building-safety-postings.md, construction-site-permits.md, concealed-carry-permits.md, currency-transaction-reports-customer.md, driving-records.md, firearms-dealer-ffl-licenses.md","Short or templated claims (e.g. 'Status: Active') are vulnerable to rainbow table attacks by the Verifier or Eavesdropper to guess values if not salted. Ensure documents include high-entropy data (nonces, timestamps, unique IDs) or explicit salts."
Usability,OCR Fragility,"employment-references.md, university-degrees.md, bank-statements.md, air-waybills.md, alarm-installer-monitoring-licenses.md, airline-passenger-documents.md, baggage-claim-receipts.md, ata-carnets.md, ballot-chain-of-custody.md, bonded-warehouse-documents.md, cold-storage-temperature-records.md, cmr-consignment-notes.md, construction-site-permits.md, container-packing-lists-vgm.md, contracts-agreements-multipage.md, dangerous-goods-declarations.md, delivery-orders-cargo-release.md, electrical-safety-inspections.md, food-hygiene-postings.md, events-permits.md","Reliance on OCR for 'Phone Camera' verification is brittle. A single character error breaks the hash. The 'Normalization' step is heavy lifting. Suggest fallback mechanisms (e.g. QR codes containing the claim text or hash) to bypass OCR issues."
Architecture,Third Party Access to Hash,"employment-references.md, university-degrees.md, bank-statements.md, account-aggregation-authorization.md, art-authentication-documents.md, b2b-credit-control.md, business-interruption-claims.md, commercial-general-liability.md, contract-signing-authority.md, cyber-insurance-policies.md, deposits-held-by-third-parties.md, environmental-site-assessments.md","In what scenario is the *Hash* handed to the Third Party? Usually the *Text* is handed over. If the Hash is sent (e.g. in a digital wallet credential), the Third Party still needs the Text to render/understand the claim. Clarify the 'Data Carriage' method."
UX,Verification Feedback Loop,"employment-references.md, university-degrees.md, bank-statements.md, air-waybills.md, actuarial-audit-opinions.md, biometric-likeness-claims.md, automated-rebalancing-confirmations.md, building-inspector-verification.md, childcare-provider-verification.md, construction-site-permits.md, credit-card-travel-benefits.md, deposits-held-by-third-parties.md, event-venue-staff.md","If the Third Party runs the tool on a document provided by the Second Party, and it fails (404/Mismatch), how do they resolve it? (e.g. 'Bad OCR' vs 'Fake Document'). The UI needs to distinguish between 'Reading Error' and 'Verification Failure'. Also consider reporting feedback loops."
Legal,GDPR/Data Controller,"bank-statements.md, employment-references.md, advance-healthcare-directives.md, adoption-custody-orders.md, asset-unfreeze-notices.md, biometric-likeness-claims.md, beneficial-ownership-declarations.md, border-crossing-receipts-i94.md, consent-records.md, criminal-background-check-results.md, drug-testing-anti-doping.md","If the Issuer logs verification requests (IPs), they process data about the Verifier. If the Verifier (e.g. Bank) uses the tool, they process data about the Subject. Clarify Data Controller/Processor roles for the 'Live Verification' tool provider."
Infrastructure,Connectivity Dependence,"air-waybills.md, alarm-installer-monitoring-licenses.md, additional-driver-endorsements.md, ata-carnets.md, blood-type-donor-cards.md, biometric-appointment-confirmations.md, bonded-warehouse-documents.md, cold-storage-temperature-records.md, cold-caller-credentials.md, cmr-consignment-notes.md, container-shipping-instructions.md, dangerous-goods-declarations.md, crane-hoist-inspection-certificates.md, delivery-orders-cargo-release.md, electrical-safety-inspections.md, endangered-species-take-permits.md, events-permits.md","Verification requires live internet access to the issuer's endpoint. This is a critical failure point for use cases in warehouses, doorsteps, or roadsides (bad signal). Suggest offline-first architecture (PKI signatures) or robust caching/retry UI."
Legal,Regulatory Inertia,"apostille-certifications.md, affidavits-sworn-statements.md, actuarial-audit-opinions.md, birth-death-certificates.md, ata-carnets.md, certified-translations.md, certificates-of-origin.md, consular-letters-attestations.md, commercial-registry-filings.md, copyrights.md, conviction-expungement-certificates.md, debt-payoff-satisfaction-letters.md, filing-completion-receipts.md","Legal frameworks often mandate physical artifacts (seals, wet ink, raised stamps) despite digital verification capabilities. Digital verification may be 'nice to have' but legally insufficient. Suggest hybrid workflow (Digital Twin + Physical Original) strategies."
Infrastructure,Physical Linkage Weakness,"bonded-warehouse-documents.md, cold-storage-temperature-records.md, chain-of-custody-forms.md, blood-type-donor-cards.md, art-authentication-documents.md, building-safety-postings.md, cmr-consignment-notes.md, container-packing-lists-vgm.md, construction-site-permits.md, dangerous-goods-declarations.md, crane-hoist-inspection-certificates.md, delivery-orders-cargo-release.md, electrical-safety-inspections.md, flood-elevation-certificates.md, fine-art-insurance.md","The digital record is verified, but the link to the physical object (label, sticker, seal) is physical and vulnerable to swapping or tampering. A verified tag on the wrong box is a valid-looking lie."
Trust Model,Input Integrity (Garbage In),"building-safety-postings.md, calibration-certificates.md, carbon-credits-offset-certificates.md, building-inspector-verification.md, commercial-invoices-customs.md, conservation-reports.md, dangerous-goods-declarations.md, crop-hail-insurance.md, electrical-safety-inspections.md, drug-testing-anti-doping.md, environmental-site-assessments.md, food-hygiene-postings.md","The issuer authenticates the document, but the data *in* the document might be fraudulent at the source (e.g. corrupt inspector, dry-labbing, lying exporter). Verification proves the *Issuer* said it, not that it is *True* in the physical world."
Architecture,Content Granularity,"commercial-invoices-customs.md, commercial-insurance-policy-documents.md, condo-townhouse-disclosures.md, consent-records.md, cruise-final-folios.md, contracts-agreements-multipage.md, data-sharing-agreements.md, film-completion-bonds.md, equity-crowdfunding-certificates.md","Verifying the *document* is real isn't enough; you need to verify specific *data fields* (e.g. 'Does it cover Cyber Liability?'). A hash of the whole PDF works, but if the user wants to check *just* one value without seeing the rest, we need granular hashing (Merkle trees) or selective disclosure."
Architecture,Stale Data / Notification Gap,"deposits-held-by-third-parties.md, driving-records.md, credit-card-travel-benefits.md, esta-travel-authorization.md, drivers-licenses-vehicle-registrations.md","Verification is a snapshot in time. Stakeholders need push notifications for state changes (e.g. License Suspended, Deposit Released) rather than re-verifying manually. Requires a subscription/webhook model."
Trust Model,Crowdsourced Reliance,"estate-clearance-authorizations.md, food-hygiene-postings.md, events-permits.md, environmental-and-vicinity-postings.md","The security model relies on the *public* (neighbors, diners) to perform the verification. If the public is apathetic or doesn't know how to scan, the fraud succeeds. Depends on high-visibility signage and public education."
Infrastructure,Operational Friction,"event-venue-staff.md, delivery-courier-verification.md","The sheer volume of physical credential production (e.g. 500 badges in 24 hours for an event) creates a logistical bottleneck that can undermine the system if issuers revert to 'easy' unverified paper to save time."
