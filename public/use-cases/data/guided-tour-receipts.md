## What is a Tour Voucher?

When you book an excursion (like a desert trek or a boat tour) through a site like Viator or TripAdvisor, you receive a **Booking Confirmation** or Voucher.

This is your "Ticket" to meet the guide at a specific time and place (often a remote boat dock or park entrance).

Small tour operators often don't have real-time computers in the field. They rely on looking at your paper or PDF voucher. Fraud is common: people often "Photoshop" a fake voucher to join an expensive tour for free. Verified hashes allow the guide to scan your paper and see "PAID" on the operator's domain instantly, even in remote areas.

## Data Verified

Lead participant name, booking reference ID, activity title, meeting point address/coordinates, start date/time, total price paid, number of participants, operator name, liability waiver status.

**Document Types:**
- **Activity Voucher:** Handed to the guide/driver.
- **Booking Confirmation:** The primary "Proof of Purchase."
- **Liability Waiver:** (Linked hash) proving the participant signed the safety terms.
- **Tour Operator License:** (Linked hash) proving the guide is officially permitted.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`sahara-expeditions.com`, `viator.com`, `getyourguide.com`) and current booking standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Confirmed** — Booking is paid and verified in the operator's system.
- **Cancelled/Refunded** — Voucher is void; do not provide service.
- **Checked-In** — Participant has already been scanned at the meeting point (fraud detection).
- **Delayed** — Start time has changed; click for new instructions.

## Second-Party Use

The **Traveler** (second party) receives the tour voucher from the operator (first party), **keeps it**, and may later hand it to third parties for various reasons, or never do so.

**Personal Record:** They have their own verified copy of the booking confirmation. Most of the time, the voucher sits in their travel documents—the verification value is latent, there *if needed*.

**Peace of Mind:** They can confirm at any time that the booking matches what the operator's system recorded and hasn't been cancelled or altered.

**Future Optionality:** If a dispute arises—whether about cancellations, refunds, or service quality—they have cryptographic proof ready without needing to contact the operator.

## Third-Party Use

The traveler (second party) may hand the verified document to various third parties:

**Tour Guides / Field Staff**
**Intake Integrity:** At a remote meeting point, the guide scans the traveler's voucher. "Verified by Sahara-Expeditions.com" ensures the traveler didn't just "Photoshop" a fake voucher to join a $600 tour for free. This is crucial for small operators who don't have expensive real-time API integrations in the field.

**Travel Insurance Companies**
**Claim Adjudication:** Verifying the authenticity of a "No-Show" or "Cancellation" certificate provided by a tour operator before paying out a travel interruption claim.

**OTA Platforms (Viator / Expedia)**
**Vendor Audit:** Ensuring that the local tour operators are issuing vouchers that match the data transmitted through the platform's API.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Voucher Forgery" Fraud Problem**

- **Duplicate Use:** Printing 10 copies of one $600 voucher and handing them to 10 different friends. Verification shows the "Checked-In" status, stopping the 2nd person at the gate.
- **Amount Tampering:** Editing a $50 "Basic Tour" receipt to read $500 to get a higher reimbursement from a company or insurer.
- **Fabricated Operators:** Creating fake tour companies with real-looking websites to sell "Vapor-Tours" to unsuspecting tourists.

**Issuer Types (First Party)**

- Local Tour Operators (Hosting on their own domain)
- Global OTAs (Viator, GetYourGuide, Klook)
- Hotel Concierge Desks

**Privacy Salt:** Not required. Tour vouchers contain many unpredictable variables that combine to create sufficient entropy—booking reference ID (unique alphanumeric), participant name (non-enumerable), specific meeting point addresses, precise date/time combinations, itemized pricing with surcharges, and operator-specific lot numbers. The combination makes reverse-engineering a specific booking computationally infeasible without already knowing the details.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing

A jurisdiction may require tour operators to retain a **witnessing firm** for regulatory compliance. The witnessing firm:

- Receives all hashes from the operator, and any subsequent changes to the payload as they happen—which may manifest as a new hash, a status change (confirmed to cancelled), or even a 404 (record deleted)
- Receives structured content/metadata (booking dates, activity types, payment amounts, meeting locations)
- Does **NOT** receive plaintext (participant names, contact details, payment card information)
- Provides an immutable, timestamped audit trail—available to the jurisdiction on demand, to travelers/third parties during disputes, or as expert witness testimony in legal proceedings

This provides:
- **Non-repudiation:** Operator cannot deny issuing the voucher or the booking terms
- **Timestamp proof:** Booking existed at a specific time (critical for cancellation disputes and insurance claims)
- **Regulatory audit:** Tourism boards or consumer protection agencies can inspect the witness ledger for fraud patterns
- **Resilience:** Verification works even if operator's systems go down or the business ceases operations

**Public Blockchain (Non-Party)**

Witnessing firms may periodically commit rollups to an inexpensive public blockchain, providing an ultimate immutability guarantee. The blockchain is a "non-party"—infrastructure, not a participant in the transaction. This creates multiple verification paths:

1. **Operator domain** — Direct check against the issuer
2. **Witnessing firm** — Independent confirmation with timestamp
3. **Public blockchain** — Decentralized trust anchor via rollup inclusion

## Competition vs. QR Codes (Offline)

| Feature | OCR-to-Hash | Standard QR Code | Scanned PDF |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Integrity** | **Cryptographic.** Binds the *Participant Name*. | **Data-Only.** Often just a raw URL or ID string. | **Zero.** Easily forged. |
| **Interoperability** | **Universal.** Any smartphone browser. | **App-Locked.** Often requires the specific "Viator" app to decode. | **Universal.** |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Bound to the Operator. | **Platform-Bound.** | **Visual.** |
| **Offline Check** | **Strong.** Protects the printed text integrity. | **None.** Requires live DB access to mean anything. | **Vulnerable.** |

**Why OCR wins here:** The "Remote Meeting" reality. Many tours start in places with terrible Wi-Fi (deserts, mountains, boat docks). A guide often has to trust the paper voucher. OCR-to-hash turns the **Printed Text** into an immutable anchor that proves the voucher's data hasn't been altered since issuance, even before the guide syncs with the home office.
