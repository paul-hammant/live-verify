## What are Public Works Notices?

Public works and planning notices are the "Community Alert System" for changes to the physical environment. From a **Planning Permission Notice** on a lamp post to a **Zoning Variance Placard** in a window, these documents inform neighbors of their legal right to object to a new development or a street closure.

The problem is that these notices are the most "Hackable" part of city government. A developer might "backdate" a notice to shorten the legal window for neighbors to file an appeal (a massive issue in jurisdictions like France). Similarly, people often use fake "No Parking - Utility Work" signs to illegally clear a street for personal use.

OCR-to-hash allows a citizen or neighbor to scan the notice from the sidewalk to verify: **"Is this notice authentic, what are the exact legal deadlines for appeal, and is this work actually authorized by the city?"**

## Data Verified

Application number, property address, owner/developer name, proposed action description, zoning class, consultation end date (appeal deadline), hearing date/time, municipal department ID, notice issue date.

**Document Types:**
- **Planning Permission Notice:** The yellow/orange placard on the street.
- **Zoning Variance Notice:** For legal exceptions to land-use rules.
- **Temporary No-Parking Notice:** For utility work or street events.
- **Tree Removal Permit:** Posted on protected vegetation.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`springfield.gov`, `london.gov.uk`, `paris.fr`) and the notice standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Active Consultation** — The appeal window is currently open.
- **Consultation Closed** — **ALERT:** Legal window for objections has passed.
- **Withdrawn** — The developer has cancelled the application.
- **Fraud Alert** — **CRITICAL:** (For No-Parking) This sign is not authorized; report to 311.

## Second-Party Use

The **Developer / Applicant** benefits from verification.

**Appeal Shield:** In many countries (like France), the legal "Appeal Clock" only starts ticking once the notice is verified as being visible from the road. The developer can take a verified, timestamped photo of the notice to prove they followed all "Public Posting" laws, preventing a neighbor from suing 2 years later because "The sign was never there."

**Compliance Proof:** A contractor can show a verified "No Parking" hash to a resident who is complaining, proving the work is authorized and that the car towing was legal.

## Third-Party Use

**Neighbors / Residents**
**Rights Enforcement:** A neighbor can scan the notice to ensure the "End Date" on the paper hasn't been "scrubbed" to hide a hearing. Verification ensures they have the full legal time to organize their community and hire a lawyer.

**City Planners / Auditors**
**Field Integrity:** Instead of relying on a developer's word, a city auditor can drive through a neighborhood and scan notices. OCR-to-hash ensures that the "Public Notice" isn't being hidden in a bush or placed in an un-readable location.

**Real Estate Agents**
**Disclosure Intelligence:** A buyer's agent can scan the notices in a neighborhood they are showing to identify upcoming construction projects that might impact the views or noise levels of a target property.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Sidewalk Scam" Fraud Problem**

- **Deadline Tampering:** Changing "APRIL 15" to "MARCH 15" on a PDF to trick neighbors into thinking they missed the objection window.
- **Project Masking:** Describing a "Luxury Hotel" as a "Small Addition" on the paper notice to avoid community pushback.
- **Fake 'No Parking' Signs:** Residents using realistic city templates to keep people from parking in front of their homes illegally.

**Issuer Types**

**City Planning Departments.**
**Public Works / Street Bureaus.**
**Environmental Protection Agencies (for tree removal).**

**Privacy Salt:** Low. These are public notices by definition. However, application IDs should be salted to prevent "Mass Scraping" of a city's development pipeline by speculators.

## Rationale

Public notices are the "Physical interface of Democracy." By turning static cards into live digital bridges, we ensure that the community's right to participate in the shaping of their environment is protected by the digital truth of the law.
