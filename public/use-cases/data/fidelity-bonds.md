## What is a Fidelity Bond?

A **Fidelity Bond** is a type of insurance that protects a business from its own employees. If an employee steals money, embezzles funds, or commits forgery, the bond pays the business back.

By federal law (**ERISA**), any company with a 401(k) plan **must** have a fidelity bond to protect the employees' retirement savings.

Companies that provide in-home services (like cleaning or IT repair) use these bonds to prove to customers: "Our workers are verified bonded." Fraud happens when a firm shows a fake $1M bond paper but only actually has a $10k bond. Verified hashes prove the **true protection limit**.

## Data Verified

Principal name (Company), bond amount, coverage type (Blanket/Position), ERISA compliance flag, effective/expiration dates, surety company name, specific exclusions (e.g., "Owners excluded"), date of issuance.

**Document Types:**
- **Blanket Fidelity Bond:** Covering all employees.
- **ERISA Fidelity Bond:** Specifically for 401(k)/Pension plans.
- **Business Service Bond:** For companies whose staff enter client homes.
- **Janitorial Bond:** Specific to the cleaning industry.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`travelers.com`, `libertymutual.com`) and current bond status.

**Status Indications:**
- **In Force** — Premium paid; bond active and legally binding.
- **Cancelled** — Bond terminated (often due to internal theft discovery).
- **Limit Depleted** — **ALERT:** Recent claims have reduced the available protection.
- **Expired** — Term ended; no coverage for current acts.

## Second-Party Use

The **Business Owner** benefits from verification.

**Client Trust:** Proving to a major client (e.g., a bank or hospital) that every employee entering their facility is "Verified Bonded" for $1M. This is a competitive requirement for high-security service contracts.

**ERISA Compliance:** Proving to the Department of Labor (DOL) that the company's 401(k) plan is properly bonded, avoiding heavy fines during a benefits audit.

**Financing:** Proving to a lender that the company's cash assets are protected from internal embezzlement, which de-risks the loan.

## Third-Party Use

**Enterprise Procurement Teams**
**Vendor Vetting:** Ensuring that the outsourced IT or Janitorial firm actually has the "Blanket Bond" they claim in their bid. Verification prevents the common fraud where a firm shows a $1M bond paper but actually only paid for a $10k bond.

**Pension Plan Auditors**
**Fiduciary Audit:** Instantly verifying that the "ERISA Bond" matches the plan's required 10% funding level, ensuring the participants' retirement funds are legally protected.

**Homeowners / Consumers**
**In-Home Service Safety:** Verifying that the contractor (e.g., HVAC or house-cleaner) has a verified bond before giving them a key to the house.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Employee Theft" Fraud Problem**

- **Ghost Bonds:** Creating a fake "Certificate of Bonding" to win a high-security contract, while actually having no coverage.
- **Limit Inflation:** Editing a $25,000 bond to read $250,000 to meet a client's RFP requirements.
- **Status Concealment:** Hiding that a bond was cancelled by the surety after a series of small "inventory shrinkage" claims.

**Issuer Types**

**Commercial Surety Carriers:** (Travelers, Liberty Mutual, CNA).
**Specialist MGAs.**
**Broker Platforms:** (e.g., BondExchange, Propeller).

## Competition vs. Broker Letters

| Feature | OCR-to-Hash | Manual Broker Letter | Scanned PDF |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Bound to the Carrier. | **Human.** Prone to social engineering or typos. | **Zero.** Easily forged. |
| **Speed** | **Instant.** 5-second scan. | **Slow.** Takes 2-3 business days. | **Instant.** |
| **Availability** | **24/7.** Works during after-hours bidding. | **Business Hours Only.** | **Universal.** |
| **Integrity** | **Cryptographic.** Binds the $ limit. | **Vague.** "They are bonded." | **Vulnerable.** |

**Why OCR wins here:** The "RFP Deadline" reality. Bids for big contracts are often submitted at midnight. A procurement officer needs to verify 50 vendors at once. OCR-to-hash turns the **Physical Bond Certificate** into a live digital anchor, ensuring that only legitimately protected firms are allowed into high-security supply chains.
