**Primary Issuers:** Organizations with direct authority to issue these documents.

**Government Agencies:** Federal, state, or local agencies with jurisdiction.

**Industry Bodies:** Trade associations and professional organizations.

**System Integration**

Verification integrates with relevant systems:

**Industry Standards:** Existing data standards extended to include verification.

**Regulatory Systems:** Government databases for systematic hash receipt and oversight.

**Third-Party Platforms:** Industry portals and platforms enable verification access.

## Rationale

Port state control verification of maritime liability insurance. Prevents fake P&I certificates for substandard vessels. Domain binding to legitimate P&I clubs. Critical for maritime safety where port authorities must verify P&I coverage before allowing vessels to enter port. Vessels carry certificates for inspection without requiring online lookups.
