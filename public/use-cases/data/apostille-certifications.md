## What is an Apostille?

If you want to use a US document (like a Birth Certificate or a Diploma) in another country (like Spain or Italy), foreign officials won't just trust a US notary stamp. They need an **Apostille**.

An Apostille is an "International Notary" certificate issued by the Secretary of State. It basically says: "We know this Notary, and their signature is legitimate."

It's a huge target for fraud—fake apostilles are often used to "legalize" fake degrees or stolen property documents for use in foreign courts.

## Data Verified

Signer name, capacity of signer (Notary/Judge/Clerk), seal/stamp identification, location of issuance, date of issuance, certificate number (Apostille ID), issuing authority (Secretary of State).

**Document Types:**
- **Standard Apostille:** For countries in the Hague Convention.
- **Certificate of Authentication:** For non-Hague countries (requires multi-step legalization).
- **Federal Apostille:** Issued by U.S. Dept of State for federal documents (FBI checks, etc.).

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`dos.ny.gov`, `state.gov`) and the document status.

**Status Indications:**
- **Verified** — Certificate is legitimate and matches the state record.
- **Invalid** — Serial number not found or details mismatch.
- **Withdrawn** — Authority has revoked the authentication (e.g., discovery of fraud in the underlying document).

## Second-Party Use

The **Document Holder** (e.g., expat, international student) benefits from verification.

**Visa Applications:** Proving to a foreign consulate (e.g., Spain, Italy) that their background check or birth certificate is legitimately authenticated for use abroad.

**Property Purchase:** Verifying their own Power of Attorney document before sending it overseas to ensure it won't be rejected by a foreign notary.

## Third-Party Use

**Foreign Governments / Registries**
**Authenticity Check:** A land registry in Greece receiving a US Power of Attorney needs to know if the "Apostille" attached to it is real. Scanning the verification link instantly proves the New York Secretary of State actually issued it, without needing to understand US state seals.

**International Banks**
**KYC/Onboarding:** Verifying corporate "Certificates of Good Standing" from foreign subsidiaries.

**Universities (Admissions)**
**Degree Validation:** Verifying that a foreign transcript's authentication is legitimate.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Fake Legalization" Fraud Problem**

- **Phony Apostilles:** High-quality forgeries of state certificates, often attached to fake degrees or fabricated legal documents.
- **Seal Theft:** Using a genuine state seal image on a fabricated certificate number.
- **Underlying Fraud:** An Apostille is only as good as the underlying signature. If the Notary signature was forged, the Apostille (if it could be verified) would be part of a fraudulent chain.

**Issuer Types**

**Secretary of State (U.S. States):** Primary issuers for state-level docs.
**U.S. Department of State:** For federal documents.
**Competent Authorities:** National ministries in foreign countries.

## Competition vs. e-Apostille (Registry)

| Feature | OCR-to-Hash | e-Apostille Registry | Wet Ink / Embossed |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **User Experience** | **Seamless.** Scan the paper you are holding. | **Difficult.** Must find the state website, type in the 12-digit ID, solve CAPTCHAs. | **Manual.** Compare seals to pictures in a book. |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** `dos.ny.gov` is the source of truth. | **Centralized.** Only works if the specific registry is known. | **Visual.** Easily fooled by high-quality copies. |
| **Offline Check** | **Medium.** Hash protects the printed text integrity. | **None.** Requires live DB access. | **Strong.** Physical security features (ribbons, grommets). |

**Why OCR wins here:** International law is slow. The "Hague Convention" relies on paper certificates attached with ribbons or staples. OCR-to-hash bridges this ancient physical process to the modern web, allowing a clerk in a small village in Italy to verify a document from California in seconds, using only their phone.
