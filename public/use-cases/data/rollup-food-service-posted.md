## Common Display Requirements

- Posted in customer-visible location
- Near entrance, register, or service counter
- Current/valid dates clearly visible
- Some jurisdictions require specific frame or holder
- Must display most recent inspection results

## Verification Value

**Problem:** Fraudulent food service documents:
- Fake "A" grades covering real "C" grades
- Expired licenses still displayed
- Counterfeit health department certificates
- Unlicensed establishments displaying fake permits

**Solution:** Customers can verify health grades and licenses are genuine before deciding to eat at an establishment. Especially valuable for tourists unfamiliar with local health department formats.
