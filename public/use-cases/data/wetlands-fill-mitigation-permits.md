## What is a Wetlands Fill Permit?

Under **Section 404 of the Clean Water Act**, it is illegal to dump dirt (fill) into a wetland unless you have an official **Fill Permit** from the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE). To get this permit, a developer must often buy "Mitigation Credits" from a **Mitigation Bank**—which uses the money to restore wetlands elsewhere.

These permits are the "Final Barrier" to construction. Fraud is high-stakes: developers often "edit" a permit to turn a "0.1 Acre Fill" authorization into a "1.0 Acre" authorization, or they create fake "Mitigation Credit Receipts" to avoid paying hundreds of thousands of dollars into a conservation fund. Verified hashes bind the **Fill Acreage, Mitigation Ratio, and Permit Serial Number** to the USACE's or the state's domain (e.g., `usace.army.mil`).

AUTHORIZED IMPACT & MITIGATION
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Total Permanent Fill:                                    0.42 Acres
Mitigation Ratio:                                           2.5 : 1
Required Credits:                               1.05 Units (Verified)
Credit Bank:                              Eco-Trust Wetland Bank #42

This permit authorizes the discharge of dredged or fill material
into jurisdictional waters. Any expansion of fill beyond the
verified acreage is a federal violation.

## Data Verified

Permit ID, permittee name, project name, total authorized fill acreage, temporary impact acreage, required mitigation credits, name of mitigation bank, credit retirement ID, effective date, expiration date, USACE District Engineer ID.

**Document Types:**
- **Section 404 Permit:** (Individual or Nationwide) The primary authorization.
- **Mitigation Credit Receipt:** Proof that conservation was paid for.
- **Dredge & Fill Manifest:** (Linked hash) for moving material onto the site.
- **Annual Monitoring Report:** Proof the restored wetland is healthy.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`usace.army.mil`, `epa.gov`, `mitigation-bank.org`) and the permit standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Active / Authorized** — Fill work is permitted and mitigation is funded.
- **Mitigation Gap Alert** — **CRITICAL:** Fill is authorized but required credits have not been retired.
- **Violation Flag** — **CRITICAL:** Field inspection found fill outside the verified boundaries.
- **Expired** — **ALERT:** The 2-year construction window has passed.

## Second-Party Use

The **Developer / Construction Firm** benefits from verification.

**Bank Progress Draws:** Before a lender releases a $5M "Site Prep" payment, they scan the verified fill permit. "Verified by USACE" ensures the bank that the developer isn't risking a federal "Cease and Desist" order, allowing the project to proceed with financial confidence.

**Public Relations:** A developer can post the verified "Mitigation Hash" on their site fence. This proves to concerned neighbors that every acre of wetland they fill is being offset by *two* acres of verified restoration elsewhere, reducing community friction.

## Third-Party Use

**Environmental Regulators (EPA / USACE)**
**Field Audit:** During a surprise site visit, the agent scans the placard. OCR-to-hash ensures the "Mitigation Receipt" in the file isn't a "Photoshopped" duplicate used for three different projects, stopping "Double-Counting" of conservation.

**Municipal Building Inspectors**
**Zoning Vetting:** Verifying that the building footprint approved by the city perfectly matches the "Fill Authorization" granted by the federal government, preventing "Jurisdictional Gaps."

**Mitigation Bank Managers**
**Inventory Integrity:** Verifying that the credits they sold to a developer have been correctly applied to the specific permit ID, maintaining the "Chain of Conservation."

## Verification Architecture

**The "Dirty Dirt" Fraud Problem**

- **Fill Inflation:** Changing a "0.1 Acre" (Minimal Impact) permit to "1.0 Acre" (Major Impact) on a PDF.
- **Mitigation Ghosting:** Removing the "Required Credits" line from a permit to save $500,000 in conservation fees.
- **ID Cloning:** Using a valid permit for a "Safe" neighboring parcel to cover for illegal work on a "Protected" parcel.

**Issuer Types**

**U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE).**
**National Mitigation Banking Registries.**
**State Wetland Protection Boards.**

**Privacy Salt:** Essential. Development plans and mitigation costs are sensitive business data. The hash must be salted to prevent "Site Mapping" by rival developers or data brokers.

## Rationale

Wetland fill is a "Point of No Return" for an ecosystem. By turning static permits into verifiable digital bridges, we ensure that every shovel of dirt moved is authorized by the digital truth of the law, protecting the planet's watersheds from the high cost of documentary deception.
