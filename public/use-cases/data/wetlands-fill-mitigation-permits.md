## Verification Architecture

**The Wetlands fill and mitigation permits (404 permits) Fraud Problem**

Document fraud creates significant risks:

- **Fabrication:** Entirely fake documents created from scratch
- **Alteration:** Genuine documents with modified content (dates, amounts, names)
- **Impersonation:** Documents falsely claiming to be from legitimate issuers
- **Expired/Revoked Documents:** Presenting invalid documents as current
- **Permit Sharing:** Using one property's permit for work at another location
- **Scope Expansion:** Expanding permitted activities beyond authorization
- **Contractor Fraud:** Claiming permits that were never obtained

OCR-to-hash verification addresses fake and altered documents. Domain binding confirms the claimed issuer actually issued the document.

**Issuer Types**

Who issues these documents and operates verification endpoints?

**Government Entities:** Counties, cities, and special districts maintain property records.

**Title Companies:** Title insurers and escrow companies for transaction documents.

**Lending Institutions:** Banks and mortgage companies for loan documents.

**Appraisal Firms:** Licensed appraisers for property valuations.

**System Integration**

Real estate verification connects to property systems:

**Recording Systems:** County recorder systems for property document registration.

**MLS Integration:** Multiple listing services for property documentation.

**Title Plants:** Title companies maintain verification for title searches.

**E-Recording:** Electronic recording systems generate verification at recording.

## Rationale

Prevents unauthorized wetland fill. Domain binding verifies Army Corps of Engineers. Clean Water Act Section 404 compliance. Prevents wetland destruction. Mitigation banking verification.
