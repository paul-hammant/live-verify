## What is a Surety Bond Release?

A surety bond release confirms that a bond obligation has been satisfied and the surety's liability has been discharged. This occurs when the bonded obligation is complete (construction finished, license period ended) or when the bond is replaced or cancelled.

Bond releases are critical for contractors, licensed professionals, and anyone who posted collateral. Fraud includes fake releases to recover collateral early or falsely claim project completion.

## Data Verified

Surety company name, bond number, principal (contractor/licensee), obligee (protected party), bond type, bond amount, project or license description, release date, reason for release, any continuing obligations.

**Document Types:**
- **Performance Bond Release:** Construction project completed satisfactorily.
- **Payment Bond Release:** All subcontractors and suppliers paid.
- **License Bond Release:** Licensed activity concluded without claims.
- **Bid Bond Release:** Contract awarded or bid withdrawn.
- **Collateral Release:** Posted collateral returned after bond expiration.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`travelers.com`, `cna.com`) and current bond status.

**Status Indications:**
- **Released** — Bond obligation fully satisfied, no continuing liability.
- **Partial Release** — Some obligations satisfied, bond reduced but not eliminated.
- **Pending Claims** — Release pending resolution of open claims.
- **Warranty Period** — Performance complete but warranty bond still active.
- **Reinstated** — Release rescinded due to discovered defects or claims.

## Second-Party Use

The **Principal (Contractor/Licensee)** benefits from verification.

**Collateral Recovery:** Principals often post certificates of deposit or other collateral to secure bonds. A verified release letter allows them to recover their collateral from the bank.

**New Bond Applications:** When applying for bonds on new projects, contractors provide their bond history. Verified releases prove they completed prior obligations satisfactorily.

**Business Sale:** When selling a company, buyers want proof that past bond obligations are fully resolved.

## Third-Party Use

**Obligees (Project Owners / Government Agencies)**
**Close-Out Verification:** Project owners need to confirm bonds are properly released before final payment. A verified release prevents disputes about continuing obligations.

**New Surety Companies**
**Underwriting:** When a contractor seeks bonds from a new surety, the new company verifies that prior bonds were released cleanly.

**Banks Holding Collateral**
**Collateral Return:** Banks won't release collateral without valid release letters. OCR-to-hash prevents fraudulent recovery of collateral before obligations are satisfied.

**Licensing Authorities**
**License Renewal:** State licensing boards may require proof that prior license bonds were released without claims before issuing new licenses.

## Verification Architecture

**The Bond Release Fraud Problem**

- **Premature Collateral Recovery:** Forged releases used to recover posted collateral before project completion.
- **False Completion Claims:** Fake releases claiming projects finished when work remains.
- **Claims Concealment:** Altered releases hiding pending or settled claims from new sureties.
- **Identity Fraud:** Using another contractor's clean bond history.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**Major Sureties:** (Travelers, CNA, Liberty Mutual, Zurich).
**Regional Sureties:** State-focused surety companies.
**Lloyd's Syndicates:** International construction and trade bonds.
**Banks:** When acting as surety or holding collateral.

**Obligee Notification**

Best practice: sureties notify obligees when bonds are released. The verification hash could be included in this notification, creating independent confirmation paths.

**State Bond Registries**

Some states maintain registries of active contractor bonds. Release notifications could include verification hashes, allowing the registry to confirm releases are genuine before updating records.


## Jurisdictional Witnessing

A jurisdiction may require the issuer to retain a **witnessing firm** for regulatory compliance. The witnessing firm:

- Receives all hashes from the issuer, and any subsequent changes to the payload as they happen—which may manifest as a new hash, a status change, or even a 404 (record deleted)
- Receives structured content/metadata (key identifiers and dates)
- Does **NOT** receive plaintext or sensitive personal information
- Provides an immutable, timestamped audit trail—available to the jurisdiction on demand, to document holders/third parties during disputes, or as expert witness testimony in legal proceedings

This provides:
- **Non-repudiation:** Issuer cannot deny issuing the document
- **Timestamp proof:** Document existed at a specific time
- **Regulatory audit:** Jurisdictions can inspect the witness ledger for fraud detection
- **Resilience:** Verification works even if issuer's systems go down

**Public Blockchain (Non-Party)**

Witnessing firms may periodically commit rollups to an inexpensive public blockchain, providing an ultimate immutability guarantee. The blockchain is a "non-party"—infrastructure, not a participant in the transaction. This creates multiple verification paths:

1. **Issuer domain** — Direct check against the issuer
2. **Witnessing firm** — Independent confirmation with timestamp
3. **Public blockchain** — Decentralized trust anchor via rollup inclusion
