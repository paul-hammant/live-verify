## What is Contract Signing Authority?

Not everyone in a company can sign contracts that legally bind the organization. **Signing authority** is the formal delegation allowing specific individuals to commit the company to contractual obligations — up to defined limits.

When you're about to sign a major deal, you need to know: does the person across the table actually have authority to bind their company? If they don't, you might have an unenforceable agreement.

## The Authority Problem

**Common disputes:**

| Scenario | What happens | Consequence |
|----------|--------------|-------------|
| **No authority** | Manager signs contract they can't authorize | Contract may be voidable |
| **Exceeded limits** | £200K authority, signed £500K deal | Enforceable to £200K? Litigation. |
| **Expired authority** | Former director signs after leaving | Company denies liability |
| **Wrong entity** | Signed for subsidiary, not parent company | Wrong legal entity bound |
| **Restricted terms** | Authority excludes indemnities, contract includes them | Partial enforceability dispute |

**The legal doctrine:** "Apparent authority" may protect the counterparty if the company held someone out as authorized. But proving apparent authority is expensive litigation — better to verify upfront.

## Data Verified

**Authorized person name**, **company name**, **company registration**, **role/title**, **contract types authorized**, **monetary limits**, **duration limits**, **specific exclusions**, **delegating authority** (board resolution reference), **validity period**.

## Data Visible After Verification

**Status Indications:**
- **Active** — Current authority in force
- **Expired** — Past validity date
- **Revoked** — Withdrawn before expiry (role change, termination, misconduct)
- **Suspended** — Temporarily inactive
- **Superseded** — Replaced by updated delegation

## Contract Types and Typical Authority Levels

| Contract Type | Typical Authority Holder | Common Limits |
|---------------|-------------------------|---------------|
| **NDAs** | Senior managers and above | Often unlimited (low risk) |
| **Sales contracts** | Sales directors, commercial leads | Revenue-based limits |
| **Procurement contracts** | Procurement, finance | Expenditure limits |
| **Employment contracts** | HR directors, hiring managers | By grade/salary band |
| **Property leases** | CFO, CEO, or board only | High risk — often reserved |
| **Financing agreements** | CFO, board | Usually board reserved |
| **M&A documents** | Board only | Always reserved matter |

## Third-Party Use

**Counterparties** — Verify before signing (especially large deals)
**Law firms** — Due diligence on transaction authority
**Lenders** — Confirm borrower representatives have authority
**Auditors** — Test delegation controls
**Insurance (D&O)** — Claims relating to unauthorized actions

## Jurisdiction Differences

| Jurisdiction | Framework | Key Points |
|--------------|-----------|------------|
| **UK** | Companies Act 2006, common law | Directors have statutory authority; delegation must be within articles |
| **US** | State corporate law, agency law | Varies by state; Delaware most common for corporations |
| **EU** | National company law | Some countries require notarized powers of attorney for certain contracts |
| **Civil law countries** | Often stricter formalities | May require specific form of delegation, registered powers |

**Cross-border deals:** When contracting with foreign entities, local law determines authority requirements. Verification is especially valuable — reduces reliance on unfamiliar legal regimes.

## Verification Architecture

**The Problem:**
- Counterparties can't easily verify if signatory has authority
- Authority documents are often confidential, not shared
- Disputes emerge years later when deals go wrong
- Former employees may still appear authorized externally

**The Fix:** Company issues signing authority confirmations to authorized individuals. Before signing material contracts, counterparty requests verification. Instant confirmation of current authority and limits.

**The negotiation flow:**
1. Deal reaches signature stage
2. Counterparty: "Please provide signing authority confirmation"
3. Signatory shares verification URL
4. Counterparty scans → sees exact authority limits
5. If contract is within limits → proceed
6. If contract exceeds limits → request escalation to higher authority

**Integration with legal tech:** E-signature platforms could require verification URL before accepting signature on contracts above certain thresholds.
