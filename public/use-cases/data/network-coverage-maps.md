## What is a Verified Coverage Guarantee?

Telecommunication providers often sell services based on coverage maps ("We have the best 5G in your area"). However, these maps are often generic marketing materials.

A **Verified Coverage Guarantee** is a specific, timestamped attestation by the carrier that a specific address or coordinate **had reliable signal strength** at the time of contract signing. It converts a marketing claim into a verifiable service level guarantee.

## Data Verified

Location coordinates, guaranteed signal metrics (dBm, throughput tier), timestamp, provider commitment.

**Document Types:**
- **Service Level Agreement (SLA) Addendum:** Attaches to the main contract.
- **Site Survey Report:** Generated after a field technician tests the site.
- **Coverage Map Snapshot:** A static, verified image of the coverage database at a point in time.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (e.g., `verizon.com`, `t-mobile.com`) and the technical signal data.

**Status Indications:**
- **Valid** — The guarantee was issued by the carrier.
- **Void** — The tower configuration has changed (superseded by new survey).
- **Historical** — Valid for the past date, but not current.

## Second-Party Use

The **Enterprise Customer** benefits from verification.

**Contract Termination:** If the carrier fails to deliver the promised speed, the customer can produce the *verified* guarantee to exit the contract without penalty. "You guaranteed -85dBm here, and I'm getting -110dBm."

**Warranty Claims:** For IoT device manufacturers, proving that a device failure wasn't due to "poor network" but rather device malfunction (or vice versa).

## Third-Party Use

**Regulators (FCC/Ofcom)**
**Truth in Advertising:** Regulators can spot-check these verified guarantees against actual performance to punish carriers for lying about coverage.

**Insurance Companies**
**Business Interruption:** If a business claims loss due to internet outage, the insurer can verify if the carrier *actually* guaranteed service at that location.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Phantom Bars" Fraud Problem**
- **Sales Puffery:** Sales reps promising "great coverage" via email, which the engineering team later denies.
- **Map Manipulation:** Showing a generic "covered" blob on a website that doesn't reflect the reality of local terrain/buildings.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)
- **Mobile Network Operators (MNOs):** AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile, Vodafone.
- **Satellite Providers:** Starlink, Iridium (guaranteeing view of sky).
- **IoT Network Providers:** Sigfox, LoRaWAN operators.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing

A jurisdiction may require the issuer to retain a **witnessing firm** for regulatory compliance. The witnessing firm:

- Receives all hashes from the issuer, and any subsequent changes to the payload as they happen—which may manifest as a new hash, a status change, or even a 404 (record deleted)
- Receives structured content/metadata (key identifiers and dates)
- Does **NOT** receive plaintext or sensitive personal information
- Provides an immutable, timestamped audit trail—available to the jurisdiction on demand, to document holders/third parties during disputes, or as expert witness testimony in legal proceedings

This provides:
- **Non-repudiation:** Issuer cannot deny issuing the document
- **Timestamp proof:** Document existed at a specific time
- **Regulatory audit:** Jurisdictions can inspect the witness ledger for fraud detection
- **Resilience:** Verification works even if issuer's systems go down

**Public Blockchain (Non-Party)**

Witnessing firms may periodically commit rollups to an inexpensive public blockchain, providing an ultimate immutability guarantee. The blockchain is a "non-party"—infrastructure, not a participant in the transaction. This creates multiple verification paths:

1. **Issuer domain** — Direct check against the issuer
2. **Witnessing firm** — Independent confirmation with timestamp
3. **Public blockchain** — Decentralized trust anchor via rollup inclusion


## Competition vs. Speedtest Apps

| Feature | OCR-to-Hash | Speedtest App (Ookla/Fast) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Time** | **Past.** Proves what was promised *at contract signing*. | **Present.** Measures what is happening *now*. |
| **Legal Weight** | **High.** It's a contract document. | **Low.** "Your phone might be broken." |
| **Granularity** | **Site Specific.** Can cover a whole warehouse campus. | **Point Specific.** Measures one device's location. |
| **Integration** | **Paper/PDF Contract.** Lives with the legal docs. | **App.** Requires active testing. |

**Why OCR wins here:**
You can't "Speedtest" the past. When a dispute arises 2 years into a contract, you need to prove what the carrier *promised* back in 2026. The verified SLA document provides that immutable snapshot.
