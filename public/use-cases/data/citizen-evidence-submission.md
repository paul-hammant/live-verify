## What is Citizen Evidence Submission?

A bystander captures evidence of wrongdoing—dashcam footage of dangerous driving, phone video of illegal dumping, photos of animal cruelty—and hands it to authorities. They want proof they submitted it.

This is different from whistleblowing:
- **Bystander, not insider:** No pre-existing connection to the wrongdoer
- **Evidence handoff:** They captured something in the moment, not knowledge they've been sitting on
- **One-part process:** Just needs acknowledgement of receipt, not timeline protection
- **Anonymity from subject:** Don't want the speeding driver to find them, not anonymity from police

## Derivation 1: Dashcam/Phone Footage to Police

**The Problem:**
You capture a car doing 122 MPH on your dashcam. You want to report it to police. But:
- Will they actually look at it?
- Can they claim they never received it?
- Will the driver find out who reported them?
- If someone dies next week from that driver, can you prove you warned police?

**How Verified Submission Helps:**

Submission ID: ES-2025-0114-7829
Received: January 14, 2025, 4:32 PM GMT

RECEIVING AUTHORITY: Greater Manchester Police
                     Roads Policing Unit

SUBMITTER: [Identity on file - not disclosed to subject]

EVIDENCE TYPE: Video (dashcam footage)
EVIDENCE HASH: 8f4a2c1e9b...
INCIDENT DATE: January 14, 2025
LOCATION: M60 Junction 17, Bolton

ALLEGED OFFENCE: Dangerous driving / Excessive speed

STATUS: Received for review
  - This acknowledges RECEIPT only
  - No commitment to prosecute is implied
  - You may be contacted as a witness

<span data-verify-line="dash">verify:gmp.police.uk/evidence/v</span> <span verifiable-text="end" data-for="dash">]</span></pre>
</div>

**What Gets Acknowledged:**
- Hash of submitted evidence (proves specific footage was received)
- Timestamp of submission
- Incident details as reported
- Submitter identity (protected from subject, available to authority)

**What Authority Commits To:**
- Receipt only—no commitment to investigate or prosecute
- Evidence will be reviewed according to standard procedures
- Submitter may be contacted if witness statement needed

**What Submitter Gets:**
- Proof they reported it (civic duty fulfilled)
- Timestamp (important if incident escalates later)
- Hash verification (proves specific evidence was submitted)
- Identity protection from the subject

**The "I Told You So" Scenario:**

If that driver kills someone next month:
- Submitter can prove they reported dangerous driving on date X
- Authority can't claim "we never knew about this driver"
- Creates accountability trail for patterns of reported behavior

## Derivation 2: Environmental/Nuisance Reporting

**The Problem:**
You witness fly-tipping (illegal dumping), noise violations, pollution, or building code violations. You report to the council. Nothing happens. You want proof you reported it.

<div style="max-width: 650px; margin: 24px auto; border: 1px solid #ccc; background: #fff; padding: 20px; box-shadow: 0 4px 10px rgba(0,0,0,0.05);">

Report ID: ENV-2025-0114-3341
Received: January 14, 2025, 9:15 AM GMT

RECEIVING AUTHORITY: Bolton Council

REPORTER: [Identity on file]

REPORT TYPE: Fly-tipping
LOCATION: Back alley, Smith Street, BL1
EVIDENCE: 3 photos attached
EVIDENCE HASH: 2d7e4f1a8c...

STATUS: Logged for inspection
  - Reference number for follow-up: ENV-2025-3341
  - Typical response time: 5 working days

<span data-verify-line="env">verify:bolton.gov.uk/reports/v</span> <span verifiable-text="end" data-for="env">]</span></pre>
</div>

**Why This Matters:**
- Proves you reported the problem (for escalation to councillors/ombudsman)
- Creates pattern if same location/offender reported multiple times
- Accountability if council fails to act and problem worsens
- Evidence for insurance claims if nuisance damages property

## Derivation 3: Animal Cruelty/Welfare Reports

**The Problem:**
You witness animal cruelty or neglect. You report to the RSPCA, animal control, or police. You want:
- Proof you reported it
- Anonymity from the animal's owner
- Evidence preservation if the animal dies

<div style="max-width: 650px; margin: 24px auto; border: 1px solid #ccc; background: #fff; padding: 20px; box-shadow: 0 4px 10px rgba(0,0,0,0.05);">

RECEIVING AUTHORITY: RSPCA

REPORTER: [Identity protected]

REPORT TYPE: Suspected neglect
ANIMAL: Dog (medium, brown, appears malnourished)
LOCATION: [Address on file]
EVIDENCE: 2 photos, 1 video

<span data-verify-line="animal">verify:rspca.org.uk/reports/v</span> <span verifiable-text="end" data-for="animal">]</span></pre>
</div>

**Anonymity Importance:**
- Animal owners may be volatile/dangerous
- Neighbours reporting neighbours need protection
- But authority needs to contact reporter for follow-up

## Derivation 4: "See Something, Say Something" Security Tips

**The Problem:**
You observe suspicious activity—unattended bag, suspicious behavior, potential terrorism indicators. You report it. You want proof you reported it, but you also don't want to be identified publicly or to the subject.

<div style="max-width: 650px; margin: 24px auto; border: 1px solid #ccc; background: #fff; padding: 20px; box-shadow: 0 4px 10px rgba(0,0,0,0.05);">

  - Thank you for reporting

<span data-verify-line="sec">verify:btp.police.uk/tips/v</span> <span verifiable-text="end" data-for="sec">]</span></pre>
</div>

**Sensitive Handling:**
- Tips may be wrong (suspicious behavior that's innocent)
- Reporter needs protection from wrongful accusation claims
- But reporter also needs protection from subject if tip was correct
- Acknowledgement confirms receipt without validating suspicion

## Verification Architecture

**Differences from Whistleblowing:**

| Aspect | Whistleblower | Citizen Evidence |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Relationship to subject | Insider (employee, etc.) | Bystander (no connection) |
| What they have | Knowledge over time | Captured evidence in moment |
| Primary risk | Being painted as participant | Retaliation from subject |
| Timeline protection | Critical (two-part) | Less critical (one-part) |
| Pre-commitment needed | Yes (proves when they knew) | Usually no (evidence speaks for itself) |
| Anonymity from | Organization/colleagues | Subject of report |

**The Evidence Hash:**

Hashing the submitted evidence is important:
- Proves exactly what was submitted
- Prevents "you edited the video" accusations
- Creates chain of custody from capture to submission
- Enables verification that authority has the original

**Metadata Considerations:**

Evidence often includes valuable metadata:
- Dashcam: GPS coordinates, timestamp, speed
- Phone video: Location, time, device info
- Photos: EXIF data (location, time, camera)

This metadata can be:
- Verified against the submission claims
- Used to corroborate the report
- Protected from the subject (location of reporter)

**Pattern Detection:**

When multiple citizens report the same subject:
- "This is the 5th dashcam submission about vehicle ABC123"
- "Three neighbours have reported this address for noise"
- "Pattern of reports from different sources = higher priority"

Authorities can aggregate without revealing reporter identities to each other or to the subject.

## Jurisdictional Considerations

**Police Evidence Submission:**
- Many forces now have online portals
- Evidence handling rules vary
- GDPR applies to reporter data
- Reporter may be required to provide witness statement

**Council/Local Authority:**
- FOI requests could expose reporter identity (exemptions apply)
- Formal complaints processes have defined timelines
- Ombudsman escalation available if ignored

**Animal Welfare:**
- RSPCA (UK) is a charity, not statutory authority
- Animal control (US) is local government
- Police involvement for serious cruelty

**Security/Terrorism:**
- Anti-terrorism hotlines have special handling
- Intelligence agencies may retain tips longer
- Special protections for tipsters

## Post-Submission Actions

**Optional Follow-Up Fields:**

Some submission systems allow structured follow-up:
- "Outcome notification requested: Yes/No"
- "Available as witness: Yes/No"
- "Contact preference: Email/Phone/Do not contact"

**Escalation Path:**

If authority fails to act:
- IPCC/IOPC for police complaints (UK)
- Local Government Ombudsman for council (UK)
- Elected representatives (councillors, MPs)
- Media (with proof of prior submission)

The verified acknowledgement becomes evidence for escalation.

## Public Blockchain (Non-Party)

Witnessing services or authorities may commit submission hashes to a public blockchain, providing:
- Proof submissions existed at specific times
- Accountability if authority claims they never received evidence
- Pattern visibility (without revealing content) for oversight bodies
- Independence from any single authority's record-keeping
