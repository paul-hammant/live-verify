## Data Verified

Poster version ID (e.g., FLSA-2026), current federal minimum wage rate, tipped wage minimum, overtime eligibility rules, child labor restriction summary, issuing authority (DOL Wage & Hour Division), effective date of latest update.

**Document Types:**
- **FLSA Minimum Wage Poster:** The primary mandatory notice.
- **FMLA Notice:** Family and Medical Leave Act rights.
- **EPPA Notice:** Employee Polygraph Protection Act.
- **Service Contract Act (SCA):** For federal contractors.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`dol.gov`) and current regulatory status.

**Status Indications:**
- **Current** — Poster contains the latest federally mandated rates and text.
- **Outdated** — **ALERT:** A new rate or legal rule has been issued; replace poster.
- **Informational** — For specific contract types (e.g., Davis-Bacon wages).
- **Invalid** — Unofficial or fabricated text found.

## Second-Party Use

The **Employer** benefits from verification.

**Audit Protection:** Proving to a Wage & Hour Division inspector during a site visit that the breakroom poster is the **Verified Latest Version**. This avoids the standard $1,100 per-violation penalty for "Outdated Labor Law Postings."

**Multi-State Compliance:** For companies with offices in 20 states, using verified hashes to track which sites have the correct Federal vs State posters in place from a central dashboard.

## Third-Party Use

**Employees**
**Wage Theft Prevention:** A worker can scan the poster to verify that the "Tipped Credit" or "Overtime" rules listed match the official federal record. Verification prevents a dishonest manager from "Editing" the poster to trick immigrant or low-wage workers into accepting lower pay.

**Labor Law Auditors**
**Rapid Inspection:** An auditor can walk through a restaurant and scan 5 different posters in 2 minutes. "Verified by dol.gov" proves the company is meeting its notification duties without the auditor needing to read the fine print.

**Union Representatives**
**Worker Education:** Ensuring that management is providing verified, accurate information about federal rights to the workforce.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Wage Deception" Fraud Problem**

- **Rate Tampering:** A manager editing the "Tipped Wage" from $2.13 to $1.50 on a PDF to steal from servers.
- **Outdated Postings:** Keeping a 10-year-old poster up to avoid informing employees about new "Sick Leave" or "Overtime" protections.
- **Compliance Scams:** Private "Poster Salesman" scaring businesses into buying $200 laminated posters that are actually fake or free from the government.

**Issuer Types**

**U.S. Department of Labor (DOL).**
**State Labor Departments.**
**Federal Contractor Agencies.**

## Competition vs. Subscription Poster Services

| Feature | OCR-to-Hash | Subscription Service (J.J. Keller) | Government PDF |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Cost** | **Free.** (Marginal hosting). | **High.** $150+/year per site. | **Free.** |
| **Integrity** | **Cryptographic.** Binds the text. | **Brand-Bound.** | **Zero.** Easily forged. |
| **Freshness** | **Real-time.** Shows if outdated today. | **Laggy.** Depends on shipping a new poster. | **None.** |
| **Accessibility** | **High.** Mobile scan for employees. | **None.** For employees. | **Visual.** |

**Why OCR wins here:** The "Compliance Shakedown." Small businesses spend millions every year on "Labor Law Poster Subscriptions" because they are afraid of missing an update. OCR-to-hash turns the **One-Time Government Printout** into a dynamic tool that tells the employer *exactly* when it needs to be replaced, saving the business money while providing better protection for workers.
