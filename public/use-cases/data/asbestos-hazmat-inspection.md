## Data Verified

Property address/location, Lab NVLAP code, sample identifiers, material descriptions, analysis results (e.g., % Chrysotile), inspector name/license, date of report.

**Document Types:**
- **Asbestos Survey Report:** Pre-renovation or pre-demolition.
- **Lead-Based Paint Inspection:** For older residential buildings.
- **Mold/Fungal Spore Report:** Post-flood or remediation.
- **Air Clearance Certificate:** Post-abatement proof that the building is safe to re-occupy.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`environsafe-labs.com`) and current report status.

**Status Indications:**
- **Final** — Report is complete and matches the lab's file.
- **Amended** — A revised report has been issued (e.g., after more sampling).
- **Void** — Report was retracted due to sampling error.
- **Cleared** — Associated with an abatement event; building is now safe.

## Second-Party Use

The **Building Owner** benefits from verification.

**Leasing Negotiations:** Proving to a potential commercial tenant that the office space is "Verified Asbestos-Free," reducing the tenant's liability concerns and speeding up the lease signing.

**Renovation Permits:** Proving to the City Building Dept that a pre-demo survey was performed by a licensed lab, allowing the permit to be issued without manual lab calls.

## Third-Party Use

**Demolition Contractors**
**Worker Safety:** Before sending workers into a building with sledgehammers, the contractor scans the posted report. Verification ensures the report isn't a "fake clean" PDF created by a shady landlord to save money on abatement.

**Mortgage Lenders**
**Risk Management:** Lenders for commercial property require environmental Phase I/II reports. Verification ensures the lab findings haven't been altered to hide a multimillion-dollar cleanup liability.

**Occupational Safety Inspectors (OSHA)**
**Enforcement:** During a site visit, OSHA inspectors can instantly verify the "Air Clearance" certificate posted on the door of an abatement zone.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Fake Clean" Fraud Problem**

- **PDF Editing:** Landlords taking a real report that found "10% Asbestos" and editing the PDF to say "None Detected" to avoid $50,000 in abatement costs.
- **Sample Swapping:** Sending "safe" samples to the lab but claiming they came from the "unsafe" building.
- **Expired Licenses:** Shady inspectors using a valid lab's letterhead after their own license has been revoked.

**Issuer Types**

**Environmental Labs:** (NVLAP accredited).
**Inspection Firms:** (Providing Phase I/II ESAs).
**State Dept of Health:** (In some jurisdictions, managing clearance databases).

## Competition vs. Lab Portals

| Feature | OCR-to-Hash | Lab Client Portal |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Field Access** | **Instant.** Scan the report on the construction fence. | **Restricted.** Requires a username/password usually only held by the owner. |
| **Permanence** | **Building Lifetime.** Text is archival. | **Ephemeral.** Labs go out of business or change software; portals disappear. |
| **Trust** | **Domain-Bound.** Bound to the Lab's web identity. | **Portal-Bound.** |

**Why OCR wins here:** Asbestos reports are "Long-Tail" documents. They may be needed 20 years after the lab that wrote them has closed. OCR-to-hash (if anchored to a durable domain or state registry) provides a way to verify building safety that persists through property sales and contractor changes.
