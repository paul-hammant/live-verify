## What are Warranty Documents?

A **Warranty Certificate** or Service Agreement is the manufacturer's promise to repair or replace a product. It defines the "Clock of Liability"—exactly when coverage starts and when it expires. For high-value items (e.g., HVAC systems, luxury watches, or enterprise servers), these documents are worth thousands of dollars in potential repair costs.

Fraud is high-volume: consumers often "edit" a purchase date on a PDF receipt to bring a broken product back into the "Warranty Window." Similarly, unauthorized "Gray Market" sellers often provide fake warranty papers to trick buyers into thinking they have manufacturer protection. Verified hashes bind the **Serial Number, Purchase Date, and Coverage Tier** to the manufacturer's domain (e.g., `apple.com`, `sony.com`, or `carrier.com`).

## Data Verified

Product serial number, model/SKU, purchase date, retailer ID, owner name (optional/masked), warranty tier (Standard/Extended), expiration date, registration timestamp, manufacturer ID.

**Document Types:**
- **Warranty Certificate:** The formal "Gold Card" or PDF.
- **Proof of Purchase (Receipt):** (Linked hash) used to trigger the warranty.
- **Extended Service Contract:** The paid insurance-like add-on.
- **Repair History Report:** (Linked hash) proving past warranty work.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`apple.com`, `samsung.com`, `rolex.com`) and the coverage standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Active / Under Warranty** — Product is eligible for free parts/labor.
- **Out of Warranty** — **ALERT:** Coverage period has lapsed.
- **Voided** — **ALERT:** Warranty was cancelled (e.g., due to unauthorized repair or gray market sale).
- **Reported Stolen** — **CRITICAL:** Serial number matches a theft report.

## Second-Party Use

The **Consumer / Product Owner** benefits from verification.

**Secondary Resale Value:** When selling a used laptop or car, the owner shows the "Verified" hash. The buyer scans it and sees **"ACTIVE WARRANTY - 2 YEARS REMAINING"** from the manufacturer. This allows the seller to charge a higher price and gives the buyer peace of mind.

**Service Center Confidence:** At a repair shop, the owner scans their own digital warranty. "Verified by Precision Chrono" ensures the technician that the repair will be paid for by the manufacturer, bypassing the 20-minute "Warranty Lookup" wait at the counter.

## Third-Party Use

**Authorized Service Centers (ASCs)**
**Payment Assurance:** Before performing a $500 repair, the ASC scans the customer's warranty hash. If it returns **"ACTIVE,"** they know the manufacturer will reimburse them for the parts and labor, eliminating the risk of unpaid work.

**Gray Market Investigators**
**Channel Integrity:** Manufacturers can scan verified hashes provided by customers to identify which "unauthorized" wholesalers are leaking products into the gray market, helping protect legitimate dealer networks.

**Insurance Companies**
**Extended Warranty Underwriting:** Verifying that a product was actually "Under Manufacturer Warranty" at the time a third-party extended policy was purchased, preventing "Pre-Existing Condition" fraud.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Serial Date" Fraud Problem**

- **Date Back-Dating:** Editing a 2024 receipt to read "2026" to get a free repair on a 2-year-old broken TV.
- **Serial Swapping:** Using a good serial number from a friend's device to get a repair for a broken, out-of-warranty unit.
- **Gray Market Mimicry:** Providing a fake "Manufacturer Warranty" card for a product imported illegally that the manufacturer refuses to support.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**Global Manufacturers (OEMs).**
**Large Retailers (Best Buy, Amazon).**
**Third-Party Warranty Admins (Assurant, Allstate).**

**Privacy Salt:** Medium. Serial numbers and purchase dates are sensitive for theft tracking and consumer privacy. The hash must be salted to prevent "Serial Harvesting" by thieves.

## Rationale

Warranties are "Value Protectors." By turning certificates into verifiable digital bridges, we protect the consumer's investment and the manufacturer's brand, ensuring that "Peace of Mind" is backed by cryptographic proof.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing

A jurisdiction may require the issuer to retain a **witnessing firm** for regulatory compliance. The witnessing firm:

- Receives all hashes from the issuer, and any subsequent changes to the payload as they happen—which may manifest as a new hash, a status change, or even a 404 (record deleted)
- Receives structured content/metadata (key identifiers and dates)
- Does **NOT** receive plaintext or sensitive personal information
- Provides an immutable, timestamped audit trail—available to the jurisdiction on demand, to document holders/third parties during disputes, or as expert witness testimony in legal proceedings

This provides:
- **Non-repudiation:** Issuer cannot deny issuing the document
- **Timestamp proof:** Document existed at a specific time
- **Regulatory audit:** Jurisdictions can inspect the witness ledger for fraud detection
- **Resilience:** Verification works even if issuer's systems go down

**Public Blockchain (Non-Party)**

Witnessing firms may periodically commit rollups to an inexpensive public blockchain, providing an ultimate immutability guarantee. The blockchain is a "non-party"—infrastructure, not a participant in the transaction. This creates multiple verification paths:

1. **Issuer domain** — Direct check against the issuer
2. **Witnessing firm** — Independent confirmation with timestamp
3. **Public blockchain** — Decentralized trust anchor via rollup inclusion
