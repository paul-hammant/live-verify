## What is a Crane Inspection?

A massive construction crane can lift 1,000 tons. If a cable snaps or a bolt shears off, it can destroy an entire city block and kill dozens of people.

Because the stakes are so high, every crane must be professionally inspected every year (under standards like OSHA in the US or **LOLER 1998** in the UK). The **Annual Inspection Certificate** is the "Safety Sticker" found in the crane cab.

"Pencil Whipping" is a common industry fraud where an operator fakes an inspection to keep working during a busy season. Verified hashes allow a site foreman or an OSHA inspector to scan the certificate and prove the crane actually passed a load test yesterday.

## Data Verified

Equipment serial number, manufacturer/model, owner name, maximum lift capacity, boom/jib configuration, load test results, inspector name/NCCCO number, date of inspection, expiration date.

**Document Types:**
- **Annual Comprehensive Certificate:** Required for site entry.
- **Monthly Frequent Inspection Log:** Ongoing safety checks.
- **Critical Lift Plan Verification:** For high-risk, multi-crane lifts.
- **Wire Rope Inspection Report:** Detailed cable integrity check.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (the Inspection Firm or Crane Owner) and current safety standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Pass/Active** — Equipment is verified safe for operation.
- **Red Tagged** — **ALERT:** Critical safety failure detected; operation prohibited.
- **Conditional** — Minor repairs required; 30-day window allowed.
- **Expired** — Annual inspection overdue.

## Second-Party Use

The **Crane Owner / Operator** benefits from verification.

**Site Mobilization:** Proving to a General Contractor (GC) that the $10M mobile crane they are driving onto the job-site is "Verified Safe." Most big GCs (e.g., Turner, Bechtel) require proof of inspection before any machine can "Swing a Load."

**Insurance Defense:** If an accident occurs, having an immutable, verified digital record of the annual inspection protects the owner from "Gross Negligence" claims.

## Third-Party Use

**General Contractors / Project Managers**
**Liability Shield:** Scanning the sticker on every crane arriving at the project. "Verified by Independent Inspector" ensures the GC isn't taking on the liability of an uninspected, potentially deadly piece of heavy machinery.

**OSHA Inspectors**
**Field Enforcement:** During a surprise job-site visit, the OSHA officer can scan the certificate in the crane cab. OCR-to-hash prevents "Pencil Whipping" where operators forge inspection dates.

**Public Safety Officials**
**Event Monitoring:** Verifying the safety of cranes used near crowds (e.g., during parades or in dense urban areas).

## Verification Architecture

**The "Fake Pass" Fraud Problem**

- **Certificate Forgery:** Using a high-quality template to create a "Passing" certificate for a crane that failed its load test due to structural cracks.
- **Serial Number Swapping:** Taking a valid certificate from a new crane and taping it to an old, dangerous machine. Verification shows the "Serial Number" which won't match the physical machine.
- **Date Stretching:** Editing a 2024 certificate to read 2026 to avoid the $2,000 cost of a professional inspection.

**Issuer Types**

**Third-Party Inspection Firms:** (e.g., Crane Inspection & Certification Bureau - CICB).
**Insurance Loss Control Units.**
**National Commission for the Certification of Crane Operators (NCCCO).**

## Competition vs. QR Stickers

| Feature | OCR-to-Hash | Standard QR Sticker | Paper Inspection Log |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Tamper Proofing** | **High.** Binds the *Serial Number* to the *Status*. | **Low.** Easily peeled off a good crane and put on a bad one. | **Zero.** Easily faked. |
| **Durability** | **High.** Text lasts longer than fragile barcodes. | **Low.** Scratches/dirt make QRs unreadable. | **Fragile.** |
| **Field Access** | **Instant.** Scan the paper/badge. | **Instant.** | **Slow.** Find the binder. |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Trust the Inspector. | **Platform-Bound.** | **Visual.** |

**Why OCR wins here:** The "Site Trailer" reality. Construction sites are dirty, wet, and harsh. QR codes on stickers often degrade within weeks. OCR-to-hash allows for **redundant verification**—even if the paper is crumpled or the sticker is scratched, the machine-readable text (backed by the hash) remains a durable link to the source of safety data.
