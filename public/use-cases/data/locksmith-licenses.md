## Data Verified

Licensee name, photo (hash), license number, business DBA name, expiration date, bonding status ($2,500 minimum typically), background check clearance date, issuing state bureau.

**Document Types:**
- **Locksmith Pocket ID:** Carried by the technician in the field.
- **Company Registration:** For the locksmith storefront.
- **Certificate of Bonding:** Proving the consumer is protected against theft.
- **Apprentice Permit:** For locksmiths-in-training under supervision.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`bsis.ca.gov`, `nc-locksmithboard.org`) and current status.

**Status Indications:**
- **Active** — License is valid; bearer is eligible to perform work.
- **Suspended** — **ALERT:** Access revoked (e.g., due to criminal record or expired bond).
- **Revoked** — Permanently barred from the profession.
- **Expired** — Renewal application or fee overdue.

## Second-Party Use

The **Locksmith (Practitioner)** benefits from verification.

**Customer Trust:** Proving to a homeowner at 2 AM that they aren't just "Some guy from Craigslist with a drill," but a verified, background-checked professional. Verification removes the "Stranger Danger" friction and allows the worker to start the bypass process immediately.

**Police Interaction:** If a locksmith is stopped by police while picking a lock (at a customer's request), the verified badge provides the officer with instant confirmation of their professional authority.

## Third-Party Use

**Homeowners / Car Owners**
**Burglary Prevention:** Criminals often pose as "Mobile Locksmiths" to gain entry to high-value properties or to duplicate keys for later use. Scanning the badge hash confirms the person is a "Verified On-Duty" professional, protecting the owner from "Fake Locksmith" scams.

**Service Marketplaces (Google / Yelp)**
**Merchant Vetting:** Google currently "Local Services Verified" for locksmiths. OCR-to-hash turns that one-time check into a **Continuous Audit Link**, ensuring that a merchant who is suspended by the state is instantly removed from the search results.

**Commercial Property Managers**
**Liability Control:** Ensuring that only licensed and bonded professionals are performing "Master Keying" on a large office complex.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Phantom Key" Fraud Problem**

- **Identity Theft:** Burglars buying realistic uniforms and fake "Locksmith" badges to case homes or install "Backdoor" locks for future entry.
- **Credential Hiding:** A technician whose license was revoked for stealing from a client keeping their physical ID to find work in a different county.
- **Bond Forgery:** Creating a fake "Certificate of Bonding" PDF to trick a landlord into allowing a high-security lock change.

**Issuer Types**

**State Licensing Boards:** (e.g., California BSIS, Nevada State Fire Marshal).
**Municipal Licensing:** (In states without centralized boards).
**Professional Associations:** (e.g., ALOA Security Professionals).

**Privacy Salt:** Critical. Locksmith names and locations are sensitive. The hash must be salted to prevent "Stalking" attacks where someone tries to track a specific technician's daily route.

## Competition vs. Review Sites (Yelp)

| Feature | OCR-to-Hash | Yelp / Google Reviews | Physical ID Card |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Bound to the State Gov. | **Social-Bound.** Trusted via crowd opinion. | **Zero.** Easily forged. |
| **Integrity** | **Cryptographic.** Binds face to license. | **Vulnerable.** Reviews can be faked/bought. | **None.** |
| **Speed** | **Instant.** 5-second scan. | **Slow.** Requires reading multiple reviews. | **Instant.** |
| **Freshness** | **Real-time.** Shows if banned *today*. | **N/A.** | **Static.** |

**Why OCR wins here:** The "Emergency Moment." Most people call a locksmith when they are locked out and stressed. They don't want to engage in a long conversation or a deep-dive on Yelp. OCR-to-hash turns the **ID Badge** into a live, non-confrontational safety tool that provides instant, high-authority trust at the door.
