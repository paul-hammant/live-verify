## What is a Scouting Report?

In professional and collegiate sports (Baseball, Football, Soccer), a **Scouting Report** is the official evaluation of an athlete's physical talent and character. It lists critical "Objective Stats"—like a 40-yard dash time, a fastball velocity (MPH), or a goal-scoring record—alongside "Subjective Grades" from a professional scout.

These documents are the "Resumes" of the sports world. They determine who gets a $1M pro contract or a full-ride college scholarship. Fraud is common: parents or agents often "edit" a report to turn a 90 MPH fastball into a 95 MPH one, or to hide a "Character Red Flag" found by a scout. Verified hashes bind the **Player's Name, Core Stats, and Scout's Credentials** to the team's or the combine's domain (e.g., `mlb.com`, `nflcombine.com`, or `imgacademy.com`).

## Data Verified

Player name, date of birth, graduation class, primary position, height/weight, physical metrics (e.g., speed, strength), performance stats (e.g., GPA, PPG), scout name/ID, scouting organization, date of evaluation.

**Document Types:**
- **Combine Result Sheet:** Data from a standardized physical test.
- **Scouting Evaluation Report:** Subjective analysis from a pro scout.
- **Academic/Athletic Transcript:** Summary for college recruitment.
- **Injury Clearance Report:** (Linked hash) proving recovery from surgery.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`ncaa.org`, `nfl.com`, `PerfectGame.org`) and the athlete's standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Verified Metrics** — Data matches the original combine/test record.
- **Suspended** — **ALERT:** The athlete has been flagged for disciplinary or eligibility issues.
- **Recanted** — **ALERT:** The scout has withdrawn the evaluation (e.g., due to discovered fraud).
- **Draft Eligible** — Confirms the athlete meets league age/academic rules.

## Second-Party Use

The **Athlete / Prospect** benefits from verification.

**College Recruiting:** A high school athlete can include a verified "Performance Hash" in their emails to college coaches. The coach can instantly see **"VERIFIED 4.4s DASH - NFL COMBINE"** on their phone, moving that player to the top of the recruitment list over players with un-verified self-reported stats.

**Scholarship Integrity:** Proving to a university that their "Elite" status is a verified fact, protecting the athlete from being "De-committed" due to unfounded rumors about their speed or character.

## Third-Party Use

**College Coaches / Pro GMs**
**Integrity Filter:** Thousands of parents send "highlight reels" and "stats." OCR-to-hash allows the front office to instantly filter for only verified, professionally-scouted talent, saving thousands of hours in manual vetting.

**Sports Agents / Agencies**
**Market Valuation:** Using verified stats to negotiate higher endorsement deals for their clients. "Verified by MLB Scouting Bureau" provides the brand (e.g., Nike) with the proof needed to sign a high-value contract.

**Anti-Doping & Integrity Units**
**Anomaly Detection:** Tracking verified physical growth patterns. If an athlete's "Verified Strength" jumps 50% in 2 months, it triggers an immediate investigation into PED use.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Dad-with-a-PDF" Fraud Problem**

- **Metric Inflation:** Editing a 4.8s dash to 4.4s to get onto a college radar.
- **Age Fraud:** Changing a player's birth year on a scouting report to make them appear more "Advanced" for their age.
- **Scout Impersonation:** Creating a fake report from a famous scout to trick a small pro league in a foreign country.

**Issuer Types**

**National Scouting Bureaus.**
**Standardized Combines (NFL, NBA).**
**Elite Athletic Academies.**

**Privacy Salt:** Critical. Athlete health data and minor PII are sensitive. The hash must be salted to prevent "Prospect Harvesting" by rival teams or data brokers.

## Rationale

Sports recruitment is a multi-billion dollar industry built on "Paper Trust." By turning scouting reports into verifiable digital bridges, we protect the fairness of competition and ensure that life-changing opportunities go to the athletes who truly have the "Jet" speed they claim.
