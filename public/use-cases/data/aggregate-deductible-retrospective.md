## Data Verified

Insured name, policy number, adjustment period (1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc.), incurred loss amount, total retrospective premium, amount due/returned, aggregate limit status.

**Document Types:**
- **Retrospective Premium Adjustment:** The bill/refund calculation.
- **Loss Run Report:** Detailed list of claims supporting the calculation.
- **Collateral Adjustment Notice:** Demand for Letter of Credit increase.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (the Insurance Carrier) and the document validity.

**Status Indications:**
- **Valid** — Document matches the carrier's system of record.
- **Void** — Adjustment was recalculated (common in retro plans).
- **Disputed** — The insured has formally contested this calculation.

## Second-Party Use

The **Insured** (second party) receives the premium adjustment statement from the insurance carrier (first party), **keeps it**, and may later hand it to third parties for various reasons, or never do so.

**Personal Record:** The insured has their own verified copy of the retrospective premium calculation. Most of the time, the document sits in their risk management files—the verification value is latent, there *if needed*.

**Peace of Mind:** The insured can confirm at any time that the calculation matches what the carrier's system recorded and hasn't been altered since they received it.

**Future Optionality:** If a dispute arises about premium amounts, or if they need to prove collateral requirements to a bank, the insured has cryptographic proof ready without needing to contact the carrier.

## Third-Party Use

The insured (second party) may hand the verified document to various third parties:

**New Insurers (Underwriters)**
When a company switches insurers, the new underwriter demands "Loss Runs" (5-year history). Companies often manipulate these PDF reports to hide bad claims and get cheaper rates. Verified documents prevent this fraud.

**Reinsurers**
Reinsurers need to verify that the primary carrier is calculating retro premiums correctly according to the treaty terms.

**M&A Due Diligence**
In a corporate acquisition, the buyer needs to know if the target company has a "ticking time bomb" of retrospective premium adjustments waiting to be billed. Verified adjustment statements reveal the true liability.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Clean Loss Run" Fraud Problem**

- **Photoshop:** Editing the "Incurred Losses" column in a PDF loss run to make a bad year look good.
- **Omission:** Deleting pages of large claims from the report.
- **Fake Paid status:** Forging a document saying "All retro premiums paid" to avoid disclosing a liability during M&A.

**Issuer Types (First Party)**

- Commercial Carriers (Chubb, Travelers, Zurich, AIG, etc.)
- Third Party Administrators (TPAs) (Sedgwick, Gallagher Bassett) who handle claims and issue loss runs

**Privacy Salt:** Required. Retrospective premium adjustments contain enumerable values—round dollar amounts for standard premiums, predictable loss conversion factors (1.10, 1.15), and common policy periods. A competitor could feasibly enumerate combinations to reverse-engineer a company's risk profile and undercut their renewal pricing. Salt protects these competitive insurance positions.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing

A jurisdiction may require insurance carriers to retain a **witnessing firm** for regulatory compliance. The witnessing firm:

- Receives all hashes from the carrier, and any subsequent changes to the payload as they happen—which may manifest as a new hash, a status change (void, disputed), or even a 404 (record deleted)
- Receives structured content/metadata (policy numbers, adjustment periods, premium amounts, loss figures)
- Does **NOT** receive plaintext (insured company names, specific claim details)
- Provides an immutable, timestamped audit trail—available to the jurisdiction on demand, to insureds/third parties during disputes, or as expert witness testimony in legal proceedings

This provides:
- **Non-repudiation:** Carrier cannot deny issuing the premium adjustment
- **Timestamp proof:** Calculation existed at a specific time
- **Regulatory audit:** State insurance commissioners can inspect the witness ledger for rate manipulation
- **Resilience:** Verification works even if carrier's systems go down

**Jurisdictional Requirements (Insurance/Reinsurance)**

Retrospective premium calculations in international reinsurance require:
- **Geographic separation:** Witness firms not in the primary carrier's jurisdiction
- **Lloyd's compliance:** High-value policies ($50M+) expect independent verification from London Market witnesses
- **Bermuda Captive Insurance:** Non-US witness firms required for policies involving US insureds to satisfy double-trigger documentation rules

**Cross-border reinsurance:** EU Solvency II requires witness firms for cross-border policy documents.

**Public Blockchain (Non-Party)**

Witnessing firms may periodically commit rollups to an inexpensive public blockchain, providing an ultimate immutability guarantee. The blockchain is a "non-party"—infrastructure, not a participant in the transaction. This creates multiple verification paths:

1. **Carrier domain** — Direct check against the issuer
2. **Witnessing firm** — Independent confirmation with timestamp
3. **Public blockchain** — Decentralized trust anchor via rollup inclusion

## Competition vs. Broker Portals

| Feature | OCR-to-Hash | Broker Portal (Marsh/Aon) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Cross-Carrier** | **Universal.** Works for any carrier document. | **Siloed.** Portals usually only show data for *current* placements. Hard to get historical data from 5 years ago/different broker. |
| **M&A Access** | **Easy.** Seller sends verified PDFs to Data Room. Buyer verifies. | **Hard.** Buyer cannot access Seller's private broker portal without complex permissioning. |
| **Immutability** | **High.** Hash proves the document hasn't changed. | **Medium.** Portal data changes dynamically; hard to prove "what was the loss number on Dec 31?" |

**Why OCR wins here:** M&A transactions and underwriting submissions rely on **static documents** (snapshots in time) exchanged between parties who don't share system access. "Here is our loss run as of Jan 1." OCR-to-hash makes that static snapshot trustworthy without requiring the recipient to log in to the sender's insurance portal.
