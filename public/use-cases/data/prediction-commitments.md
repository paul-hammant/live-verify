## What is a Prediction Commitment?

Anyone can claim "I predicted that" after the fact. A **Prediction Commitment** locks in a prediction *before* the outcome is known—hash committed, timestamped, verifiable. Forecaster track records become auditable.

## Why Prediction Commitments Matter

**Accountability:** Pundits, analysts, and forecasters make predictions constantly. Without commitment records, they can cherry-pick successes and forget failures.

**Calibration:** Over time, verified prediction records show whether someone is well-calibrated (70% predictions come true 70% of the time).

**Incentives:** Knowing predictions will be verified encourages more careful forecasting.

**Trust:** Hire the forecaster with verifiable track record, not the one with unverifiable claims.

## Data Verified

Forecaster identity, prediction question/scope, predicted value or probability, commitment timestamp, resolution criteria, resolution date, outcome (when resolved), accuracy metrics.

**Document Types:**
- **Probability Forecast:** Percentage likelihood of event
- **Point Estimate:** Specific predicted value (with confidence interval)
- **Range Forecast:** Expected range (revenue $4.2B-$4.5B)
- **Personal Commitment:** Goals with accountability stakes
- **Project Estimate:** Timeline and budget predictions
- **Conditional Forecast:** "If X happens, then Y will follow"

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (forecasting platform, institution, or self-published) and resolution status.

**Status Indications:**
- **Pending** — Prediction made, outcome not yet known
- **Resolved: Correct** — Prediction matched outcome
- **Resolved: Incorrect** — Prediction did not match outcome
- **Resolved: Partial** — Partially correct (for range/probability forecasts)
- **Ambiguous** — Resolution criteria unclear or disputed
- **Withdrawn** — Forecaster withdrew prediction (with timestamp)

## Second-Party Use

The **Forecaster** benefits from verification.

**Reputation Building:** Verified track record proves forecasting skill.

**Differentiation:** "I committed to this prediction before the event" is provable.

**Self-Accountability:** Public commitment changes behavior.

## Third-Party Use

**Media**
**Expert Selection:** Invite commentators with verified good track records.

**Investors**
**Analyst Evaluation:** Which analysts' forecasts are actually reliable?

**Organizations**
**Hiring Decisions:** For forecasting roles, verified track record beats interview performance.

**Researchers**
**Methodology Validation:** Compare forecasting methods by verified outcomes.

## Verification Architecture

**Pre-Commitment Requirement**

The hash is published *before* the outcome is known. Post-hoc predictions are worthless for accountability.

Timeline:
1. Prediction committed (hash published)
2. Waiting period (outcome uncertain)
3. Outcome occurs
4. Resolution recorded
5. Verification shows complete record

**Resolution Criteria**

Good predictions have clear resolution criteria defined upfront:
- "GPT-5 released" needs definition of "released"
- "Inflation exceeds 4%" needs specification of which index
- Ambiguous criteria lead to disputed resolutions

**Probability Calibration**

For probability forecasts, accuracy is measured over many predictions:
- 70% confidence predictions should be right ~70% of the time
- Brier scores measure calibration quality
- Verification can show long-term calibration

**Track Record Aggregation**

Individual predictions compose into track records:
- Total predictions made
- Accuracy by category
- Calibration curves
- Comparison to baseline (random, consensus)

## Novel Applications

**Forecaster Markets**
Hire forecasters based on verified track records for specific domains.

**Decision Records**
Organizations commit to predictions underlying decisions. Post-hoc: "Did our assumptions hold?"

**Accountability Journalism**
Political promises as commitments. Verified resolution at term end.

**Research Pre-Registration**
Scientific predictions committed before experiments. Prevents p-hacking and HARKing.


## Jurisdictional Witnessing

A jurisdiction may require the issuer to retain a **witnessing firm** for regulatory compliance. The witnessing firm:

- Receives all hashes from the issuer, and any subsequent changes to the payload as they happen—which may manifest as a new hash, a status change, or even a 404 (record deleted)
- Receives structured content/metadata (key identifiers and dates)
- Does **NOT** receive plaintext or sensitive personal information
- Provides an immutable, timestamped audit trail—available to the jurisdiction on demand, to document holders/third parties during disputes, or as expert witness testimony in legal proceedings

This provides:
- **Non-repudiation:** Issuer cannot deny issuing the document
- **Timestamp proof:** Document existed at a specific time
- **Regulatory audit:** Jurisdictions can inspect the witness ledger for fraud detection
- **Resilience:** Verification works even if issuer's systems go down

**Jurisdictional Requirements (Insurance)**

Insurance regulation is heavily fragmented:

**US Domestic Insurance:** State insurance commissioners do not mandate witness firms; companies maintain independent records via NAIC databases and state filings.

**Cross-Border Insurance / Reinsurance:** International reinsurance treaties increasingly demand independent witness firms:
- **Lloyd's of London & London Market:** Expect independent verification for catastrophe claims and high-value policies
- **EU Insurance Directive (Solvency II):** May require witness firms for cross-border policy documents
- **Bermuda (Captive Insurance):** Non-US witness firms required for policies involving US insureds to satisfy double-trigger documentation rules

**Litigation/Claims:** Once insurance moves to litigation phase, court-appointed independent witnesses become mandatory, superseding issuer verification entirely.

**Public Blockchain (Non-Party)**

Witnessing firms may periodically commit rollups to an inexpensive public blockchain, providing an ultimate immutability guarantee. The blockchain is a "non-party"—infrastructure, not a participant in the transaction. This creates multiple verification paths:

1. **Issuer domain** — Direct check against the issuer
2. **Witnessing firm** — Independent confirmation with timestamp
3. **Public blockchain** — Decentralized trust anchor via rollup inclusion
