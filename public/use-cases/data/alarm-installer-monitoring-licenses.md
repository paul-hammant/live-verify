## What is an Alarm Installer License?

In many states, anyone who installs security cameras, burglar alarms, or fire sensors in your home must be licensed and background-checked by the State Police or a regulatory bureau.

This license proves that the technician:
1.  **Is not a criminal:** They have passed a fingerprint-based background check.
2.  **Is trained:** They understand fire codes and electrical safety.
3.  **Is insured:** If they damage your home or the system fails, there is a bond or insurance to cover it.

Always scan the badge before letting a "technician" into your home to learn your security codes.

## Data Verified

Licensee name, photo (hash), license number, company affiliation, expiration date, endorsements (fire, burglary, access control), issuing state agency.

**Document Types:**
- **Pocket Card:** Carried by the technician.
- **Wall Certificate:** Posted at the business office.
- **Monitoring Station License:** For the central station itself.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`dps.texas.gov`, `bsis.ca.gov`) and current status.

**Status Indications:**
- **Active** — License is valid.
- **Suspended** — Disciplinary action or lapsed insurance.
- **Revoked** — Permanently barred from the industry.
- **Expired** — Renewal fee not paid.

## Second-Party Use

The **Homeowner** or **Business Owner** benefits from verification.

**Safety Check:** Before letting a stranger into your home to install cameras/sensors, scanning their ID card verifies they are a licensed, background-checked professional and not an impostor casing the house.

**Insurance Compliance:** Many homeowner insurance policies give discounts for monitored alarms, but *only* if installed by a licensed professional. A verified license proves eligibility.

## Third-Party Use

**Police Departments**
**False Alarm Fines:** Police often refuse to respond to unpermitted alarms. Verifying the monitoring company's license ensures they are a legitimate entity that follows verified dispatch protocols (ECV - Enhanced Call Verification).

**Fire Marshals**
**Inspection:** Fire alarm systems must be installed by licensed fire professionals. Marshals can scan the installer's badge on-site to ensure code compliance.

**General Contractors**
**Subcontractor Vetting:** Ensuring the security sub-contractor is licensed prevents liability issues on large construction projects.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Fake Installer" Fraud Problem**

- **Casing Burglars:** Criminals posing as alarm technicians to gain access to homes, learn codes, and identify valuables.
- **Unlicensed Moonlighting:** Technicians doing side jobs without company insurance/bonding. If they burn the house down, the homeowner is unprotected.
- **Expired Licenses:** Technicians working after their background check has lapsed.

**Issuer Types**

**State Bureaus:** (e.g., California BSIS, Texas PSB)
**State Police:** (In some jurisdictions)

## Competition vs. Online Lookups

| Feature | OCR-to-Hash | State Website Lookup |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Speed** | **Instant.** Scan the badge at the door. | **Slow.** Ask for name, type it in, scroll results. |
| **Photo ID** | **Strong.** Verification can display the official photo to compare with the person standing there. | **Weak.** Text-only lookups don't show the face, allowing ID theft (using a real name but wrong person). |
| **Privacy** | **Targeted.** Checks *this* person. | **Open.** Anyone can scrape the whole database. |

**Why OCR wins here:** The "Doorstep Scenario." A homeowner opening the door to a technician needs to verify them *now*, in seconds. They are not going to go to a computer, find the state DPS website, and navigate a search form while the person waits on the porch. Scanning the badge is the only viable workflow.
