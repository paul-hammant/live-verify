## What is a Renewable Energy Certificate?

In the energy market, a **Renewable Energy Certificate (REC)** is the proof that 1 Megawatt-hour (MWh) of electricity was generated from a renewable source (Solar, Wind, Hydro) and delivered to the grid. These certificates are the "Currency of Green Power." Companies buy RECs to prove they are using "100% Renewable Energy" for their factories or data centers.

The problem is that a REC can only be used once. "Double-Counting" is a massive fraud where a solar farm sells the same MWh of energy to two different companies. Similarly, shady firms create fake "Green Certificates" to greenwash their carbon footprint. Verified hashes bind the **Generator ID, MWh Amount, and Vintage Year** to the tracking registry's domain (e.g., `mirecs.org` or `wregis.org`).

## Data Verified

Certificate ID, facility name, facility ID, fuel type (Solar/Wind/etc.), balancing authority (e.g., CAISO), vintage month/year, total MWh quantity, purchaser name (if retired), date of generation, date of registry entry.

**Document Types:**
- **REC Certificate:** The primary asset for trading or compliance.
- **Retirement Report:** Proof that the MWh was "consumed" and can't be re-sold.
- **Generation Summary:** The aggregate output of a facility for a month.
- **PPA (Power Purchase Agreement) Extract:** (Linked hash) proving the long-term deal.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`wregis.org`, `mirecs.org`, `apx.com`) and the asset standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Active / Tradable** — Certificate is valid and can be sold to a buyer.
- **Retired** — **ALERT:** The green attributes have been "used" by a buyer (shows owner name).
- **Cancelled** — **CRITICAL:** The generation was found to be erroneous or fraudulent.
- **Pledged** — **ALERT:** The REC is held as collateral for a trade-finance loan.

## Second-Party Use

The **Energy Buyer (Corporation)** benefits from verification.

**ESG Reporting Speed:** When a company like Google or Amazon files its annual "Sustainability Report," they include the verified hashes of their REC portfolio. Auditors can instantly see **"VERIFIED RETIRED - 1,000 MWh"** on their phone, removing the need for a 2-week manual audit of registry portal logins.

**Greenwashing Defense:** If a competitor accuses a brand of "Fake Green Claims," the company can point to the verified REC hashes on its public website. This provides the cryptographic proof needed to stop a PR crisis instantly.

## Third-Party Use

**Carbon and ESG Auditors**
**Inventory Audit:** During a "Net Zero" audit, the accountant scans a random sample of the client's RECs. OCR-to-hash ensures the company isn't "Double-Counting" RECs or using "Phantom Credits" from a non-existent solar farm.

**Energy Traders / Banks**
**Transaction Security:** Before buying 50,000 RECs from a broker, the trader scans the hash. Verification ensures the seller actually owns the RECs and that they haven't already been "Retired" by someone else.

**Regulators (FTC / State Boards)**
**Consumer Protection:** Verifying that "Green Energy" retail plans sold to homeowners are actually backed by verified, retired RECs as required by law.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Ghost MWh" Fraud Problem**

- **Double-Counting:** Selling the same 1 MWh of solar energy to two different buyers using two separate paper certificates.
- **Vintage Inflation:** Editing a 2023 REC to read "2026" because newer vintage years are more valuable.
- **Fuel Type Masking:** Describing "Dirty" energy as "Renewable" on a fake certificate.

**Issuer Types**

**Regional Energy Registries (WREGIS, NEPOOL).**
**National Tracking Systems.**
**Independent Verification Bodies (e.g., Green-e).**

**Privacy Salt:** Essential. Specific trade volumes and prices are sensitive business data. The hash must be salted to prevent "Market-Volume Mapping" by competitors.

## Rationale

RECs are the "Digital Integrity" of the green economy. By turning static certificates into verifiable digital bridges, we protect the multibilion-dollar transition to clean power and ensure that "100% Green" is a cryptographic fact, not a marketing gimmick.
