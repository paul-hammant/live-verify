## What is a Consular Attestation?

If you are an expat living in a foreign country, your home government's **Embassy** acts as your local "High-Level Notary."

A **Consular Letter** (or Attestation) is a formal document from a diplomat stating a fact about you (e.g., "We certify that Sarah Smith has a pension of $3,000/month").

Foreign governments (like Thailand or Spain) require these letters for visas. Because they are so powerful, "Embassy Letter Forgery" is a massive industry. Verified hashes allow a foreign immigration officer to scan the letter and see "VERIFIED" on the official `usembassy.gov` domain in seconds.

## Data Verified

Applicant name, passport number (partial), attestation reference number, consular officer name/rank, embassy/consulate location, date of issuance, specific fact being attested (e.g., residency, signature, income).

**Document Types:**
- **Income Attestation:** For retirement or digital nomad visas.
- **Statement of No Impediment:** For getting married abroad.
- **Criminal Record Attestation:** Local missions verifying home-country background checks.
- **Consular Marriage Certificate:** Issued by some missions for citizens abroad.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`usembassy.gov`, `gov.uk`, `diplomatie.gouv.fr`) and current validity.

**Status Indications:**
- **Verified** — Letter is authentic and matches the mission's log.
- **Void** — Retracted due to discovery of fraudulent underlying documents.
- **Expired** — Many consular letters are only valid for 3-6 months.
- **Invalid** — Serial number or details mismatch.

## Second-Party Use

The **Citizen abroad** benefits from verification.

**Visa Approval:** Proving to a foreign immigration office (e.g., Thai Immigration or Spanish Extranjería) that their "Income Letter" is a legitimate diplomatic document and not a "High-Quality Forgery." Verification prevents the 30-day delay of "Consular Confirmation" via email.

**Property Purchase:** Verifying a consular-authenticated Power of Attorney to satisfy a local notary in a foreign country.

## Third-Party Use

**Foreign Immigration Authorities**
**Efficiency:** Instead of sending batch emails to embassies to confirm "Did you issue these 50 letters?", the immigration officer scans the hashes at the desk. "Verified by usembassy.gov" provides instant diplomatic-level trust.

**International Banks**
**KYC/Onboarding:** Verifying the "Address Attestation" of an expat client trying to open a local account.

**Foreign Notaries**
**Legalization Proof:** Confirming that the consular stamp on a legal document is authentic before performing a local notarial act.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Fake Embassy" Fraud Problem**

- **High-End Forgeries:** Using heavy bond paper and fake embossed seals to create "Income Letters" for people who don't meet the financial requirements for a visa.
- **Signature Swapping:** Taking a real letter from a low-income person and editing the name and amount to match a high-value fraudster.
- **Unauthorized Issuance:** Local staff at a consulate issuing "under-the-table" letters that aren't in the official system. Verification only shows hashes from the official ledger.

**Issuer Types**

**National Ministries of Foreign Affairs:** (e.g., U.S. State Dept, UK FCDO).
**Embassies & Consulates.**
**Consular Sections of Representative Offices:** (e.g., for Taiwan/AIT).

**Privacy Salt:** Critical. Consular records involve citizenship and financial data. The hash must be salted to prevent "Guessing" the names of citizens living in a specific foreign city.

## Competition vs. Legalization (Apostille)

| Feature | OCR-to-Hash | Apostille / Legalization | Scanned PDF |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Bound to the Mission. | **Seal-Bound.** Trust the physical stamp. | **Zero.** Easily forged. |
| **Speed** | **Instant.** 5-second scan. | **Slow.** Often requires weeks of multi-step processing. | **Instant.** |
| **Integrity** | **Binds Content.** Proves the *Income* amount. | **Binds Signature.** Doesn't protect the data on the page. | **Vulnerable.** |
| **Cost** | **Low.** Standard web infra. | **High.** Fees can be $50-$200 per document. | **None.** |

**Why OCR wins here:** The "Expat Life" reality. Consular letters are often "Fast-Track" alternatives to the heavy, expensive Apostille process. OCR-to-hash provides **Apostille-level integrity** with the speed and low cost of a simple letter, making international life much more efficient for citizens and governments alike.
