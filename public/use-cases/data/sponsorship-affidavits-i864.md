## What is an I-864 Affidavit of Support?

The **I-864 Affidavit of Support** is a legally binding contract between a US sponsor and the US government. By signing it, the sponsor agrees to financially support an immigrant so they don't become a "Public Charge" (dependent on government welfare). If the immigrant receives certain public benefits, the government can sue the sponsor for reimbursement.

These documents are high-stakes legal instruments. Fraud is common: people often "Photoshop" an I-864 to inflate their income (to meet the poverty guidelines) or to forge a signature from a wealthy relative who never actually agreed to be a sponsor. Verified hashes bind the **Sponsor Name, Income Level, and Beneficiary Name** to the `uscis.gov` domain.

## Data Verified

Sponsor name, beneficiary name, household size, most recent tax-year income, total assets (if used for qualification), date of signature, sponsor's citizenship status, case receipt number.

**Document Types:**
- **I-864 Affidavit of Support:** The primary long-form contract.
- **I-864A Contract Between Sponsor and Household Member:** (Linked hash) for joint income.
- **I-864EZ:** Simplified version for certain sponsors.
- **IRS Tax Transcript:** (Linked hash) proving the income stated on the I-864.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`uscis.gov`) and the contract standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Verified / Enforceable** — Contract is on file and meets poverty guidelines.
- **Income Mismatch** — **ALERT:** The income on the paper does not match the verified tax record.
- **Revoked** — **ALERT:** The sponsor has attempted to withdraw the petition (restricted).
- **Superseded** — A newer sponsor has been added to the case.

## Second-Party Use

The **Immigrant (Beneficiary)** benefits from verification.

**Visa Interview Confidence:** At a consular interview, the beneficiary shows the verified hash of their sponsor's I-864. The officer can instantly see **"VERIFIED INCOME: $78,450"** directly from USCIS records, removing the common "Consular Suspicion" that leads to 221(g) administrative processing delays.

**Public Benefit Defense:** If an immigrant is wrongly accused of being a "Public Charge," they can provide the verified sponsorship hash to prove they have a solvent legal backer who is responsible for their support.

## Third-Party Use

**Consular Officers / Consulates**
**Fraud Detection:** Thousands of fake I-864s are submitted globally every year. OCR-to-hash connects the officer directly to the US-based record in seconds, stopping "Immigration Consultant" scams where fake sponsors are sold to applicants.

**State Welfare Agencies**
**Asset Recovery:** If an immigrant applies for Medicaid or SNAP, the state agency scans the I-864 hash. They can identify the sponsor and initiate a reimbursement claim against them for the cost of the benefits provided.

**Attorneys / Non-Profits**
**Case Management:** Verifying that the client's sponsor actually meets the 125% Poverty Guidelines before submitting the final green card packet.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Income Padding" Fraud Problem**

- **Threshold Inflation:** Changing a $20,000 income to $45,000 on a PDF to bypass the poverty line.
- **Signature Forgery:** Using a high-end printer to place a relative's signature on an affidavit they never saw.
- **Stale Data:** Presenting a 2023 tax return as if it were the "Most Recent" 2025 record.

**Issuer Types**

**U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS).**
**Department of State (DOS) Consular Posts.**

**Privacy Salt:** Highly Critical. Sponsor income and PII are protected under the Privacy Act. The hash must be salted to prevent "Income Enumeration" attacks against the US population.

## Rationale

Sponsorship is the "Financial Safety Net" of immigration. By turning the I-864 into a verifiable digital bridge, we ensure that the US government can hold sponsors accountable and that legitimate families can move through the visa process without unfair delays.
