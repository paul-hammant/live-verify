## What is a Vital Record?

**Birth and Death Certificates** are the "Breeding Documents" of identity. Almost every other ID (Passport, Driver's License, Social Security Card) is issued based on a Birth Certificate.

Because they are so powerful, they are the #1 target for identity thieves. A criminal can use the birth certificate of a child who died young to "become" that person, opening bank accounts and taking out loans.

Verified vital records allow banks and agencies to check the **Live Status** of the person (e.g., "This birth certificate is real, but the person is marked as DECEASED in our database") to stop identity theft cold.

## Data Verified

Full name at birth, date of birth, place of birth (City/County/State), parents' full names (including maiden), sex, file/registration number, date of registration, date of issuance.

**Document Types:**
- **Standard Birth Certificate:** Long or short form.
- **Death Certificate:** Including date/place of death and social security number.
- **Stillbirth Certificate:** (Certificate of Birth Resulting in Stillbirth).
- **Consular Report of Birth Abroad (CRBA):** For citizens born overseas.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`health.pa.gov`, `cdc.gov`) and current record status.

**Status Indications:**
- **Verified** — Record matches the vital statistics database.
- **Amended** — Original record was legally changed (e.g., adoption or name change).
- **Deceased** — (For Birth Certs) Cross-referenced with death registry to prevent "Ghost" identity theft.
- **Invalid** — File number mismatch or known fraudulent document series.

## Second-Party Use

The **Named Person** or **Next of Kin** benefits from verification.

**Passport Applications:** Proving to the State Department that the birth certificate isn't a "High-Quality Forgery" (a common issue with older paper records).

**Real ID Licensing:** Speeding up DMV verification by providing a "Verified Link" to the birth record, reducing the chance of rejection due to "unclear paper."

**Estate Settlement:** Proving to a bank or life insurer that a family member has indeed passed away using a verified death certificate.

## Third-Party Use

**The State Department (Passport Agency)**
**Identity Integrity:** Passport fraud is often built on stolen or fake birth certificates. Verification directly against the issuing state's domain stops "Paper Forgery" cold.

**Banks and Lenders**
**KYC/Onboarding:** Using the birth certificate as a foundational "Breeding Document" for identity. Verification prevents fraudsters from using deceased persons' identities to open lines of credit.

**Genealogists / Historians**
**Record Accuracy:** Ensuring that historical records being used for lineage research are authentic government-issued documents.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Breeding Document" Fraud Problem**

- **Ghosting:** Using the birth certificate of a child who died young to assume their identity. Verification catches this by showing a "DECEASED" flag on the birth record.
- **Alteration:** Changing the date of birth to appear younger (for sports/schools) or older (for retirement benefits).
- **Fictitious Records:** Creating a realistic birth certificate for a non-existent person to get a "real" ID.

**Issuer Types**

**State Departments of Health:** (Managing Vital Statistics).
**County Clerks:** (In some jurisdictions).
**Embassies/Consulates:** (For CRBA).

**Privacy Salt:** Critical. Vital records are protected by law. The hash must be salted to prevent enumeration/guessing of birth records.

## Competition vs. Physical Security (Paper)

| Feature | OCR-to-Hash | Security Paper (Intaglio/Void) | EVVE (Gov-to-Gov) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Integrity** | **Cryptographic.** Protects the *text*. | **Mechanical.** Protects the *paper*. | **Database.** Direct server check. |
| **Public Access** | **Restricted.** Only person with the cert can verify. | **Visual.** Anyone can look at it. | **Zero.** Only Gov agencies have access. |
| **Interoperability** | **High.** Any employer/bank can verify. | **Low.** Requires expert knowledge of 50 different state paper types. | **None.** Private Gov-only network. |
| **Cost** | **Low.** Standard web infra. | **High.** Specialty printing and chemical paper. | **High.** Per-query fees are common. |

**Why OCR wins here:** Reach. EVVE is great but only works for government agencies. Banks, employers, and foreign governments are locked out. OCR-to-hash allows **private-sector verifiers** to have "Passport Agency Level" trust in a piece of paper, without compromising the central government database.
