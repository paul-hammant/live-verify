## What is an Actuarial Opinion?

Insurance companies don't sell products; they sell promises ("If your house burns down, we pay"). The danger is that they might collect premiums today but not have enough money to pay claims tomorrow.

An **Actuarial Opinion** is a formal certification by a math expert (an Actuary) stating: "I have calculated the numbers, and this insurance company has set aside enough money (reserves) to pay its future claims."

If this document is faked or altered, regulators might let a bankrupt insurance company keep selling policies, leading to disaster.

## Data Verified

Appointed actuary name, qualifications (FCAS/MAAA), valuation date, company subject to opinion, opinion type (Reasonable, Redundant, Excessive, Qualified, No Opinion), ASOP compliance statement.

**Document Types:**
- **Statement of Actuarial Opinion (SAO)**
- **Actuarial Opinion Summary (AOS)**
- **Loss Reserve Specialist Report**

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (the actuarial firm) and the current validity.

**Status Indications:**
- **Valid** — Opinion was issued by the firm and has not been withdrawn.
- **Withdrawn** — The actuary or firm has retracted the opinion (e.g., due to discovery of data errors).
- **Superseded** — A revised opinion has been issued.

## Second-Party Use

The **Insurance Company** (client) benefits from verification.

**Regulatory Filing:** Proving to state insurance commissioners that the opinion is authentic and from a qualified actuary.

**Rating Agency Review:** Providing A.M. Best or S&P with verified opinions to support financial strength ratings.

**Board Assurance:** Giving directors confidence that the opinion in their board pack is the exact text signed by the external actuary, without modification by management.

## Third-Party Use

**State Insurance Regulators**

**Solvency Monitoring:** Regulators receive thousands of SAOs annually. Systematic hash verification ensures that the PDF filed matches the one issued by the actuarial firm, preventing "edit-and-file" fraud.

**Auditors**

**Financial Statement Audit:** External financial auditors (Big 4) rely on the specialist work of actuaries. Verification confirms the reliance on the specialist is well-founded.

**Reinsurers**

**Treaty Pricing:** Reinsurers reviewing ceding company data need to trust the reserve adequacy opinions. Verification builds trust in the underlying data quality.

## Verification Architecture

**The Actuarial Fraud Problem**

- **Rogue Actuary:** An individual actuary issuing an opinion on firm letterhead without going through the firm's internal peer review or quality assurance process.
- **Management Tampering:** Company management slightly altering the "Risk of Material Adverse Deviation" section to sound less alarming before filing.
- **Qualification Inflation:** An actuary signing an opinion for a line of business they aren't qualified for (e.g., a health actuary signing a property casualty opinion).

**Issuer Types**

**Actuarial Consulting Firms:** (Milliman, Willis Towers Watson, Oliver Wyman, etc.)
**Internal Actuarial Departments:** (For large carriers with internal appointed actuaries)

**Domain Binding Value:**
Binding the opinion to `milliman.com` (for example) proves that the *firm* stands behind the opinion, not just the individual signer. If an actuary goes rogue, the firm won't publish the hash.

## Competition vs. Digital Signatures (PKI)

| Feature | OCR-to-Hash | Digital Signature (PKI) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Workflow Integration** | **Seamless.** Works on printed copies in board books or scanned PDFs in data rooms. | **Fragile.** Breaks if the PDF is printed, scanned, or flattened. |
| **Verifier Access** | **Universal.** Anyone with a browser. | **Restricted.** Often requires specific software or trust anchors to validate the signature chain. |
| **Revocation** | **Instant.** Issuer removes hash or changes status to WITHDRAWN. | **Complex.** Requires CRL (Certificate Revocation List) or OCSP checking, which often fails in long-term archives. |
| **Firm vs. Individual** | **Firm-Centric.** Binds to the firm's domain. | **Individual-Centric.** Binds to the signer's personal token (unless using expensive corp seals). |

**Why OCR wins here:** Actuarial opinions travel through many hands: drafted in Word, PDF'd, emailed to client, printed for Board meeting, scanned for regulator, uploaded to data room. PKI signatures rarely survive this journey intact. OCR-to-hash survives printing and scanning, ensuring the *content* remains verifiable at every step.
