## What is a Health Insurance Rate Filing?

Insurance companies cannot just raise your premiums whenever they want. In most states, they must submit a formal **Rate Filing** to the government explaining the math behind the price hike.

The **Actuarial Certification** is the heart of this filing. A math expert (the Actuary) must swear that the new rates are "Fair" and that at least 80% of the premium will be spent on actual medical care.

Verification ensures that the "4.2% Average Increase" the company announces to the public matches the verified math they submitted to the regulators. It prevents "Messaging Fraud" where companies hide large price hikes for specific groups.

## Data Verified

Certifying actuary name/qualifications, insurer name, specific plan portfolio (e.g., "2027 Individual PPO"), proposed % increase, medical loss ratio (MLR) projection, medical cost trend assumptions, filing ID, jurisdiction of approval.

**Document Types:**
- **Actuarial Memorandum:** The technical justification for rates.
- **Rate Filing Summary:** For public review periods.
- **MLR Compliance Report:** Annual proof that 80-85% of premiums went to care.
- **State DOI Approval Letter:** (Linked hash) for legal authorization.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (the Insurance Carrier or the Actuarial Firm) and the filing status.

**Status Indications:**
- **Filed & Approved** — Rates are legally authorized for sale.
- **Under Regulatory Review** — Filing is active but pending state DOI approval.
- **Withdrawn/Rejected** — Rates were found excessive or flawed.
- **Superseded** — Replaced by a corrected or later filing.

## Second-Party Use

The **Insurer's Compliance Officer** benefits from verification.

**Regulatory Defense:** Proving to a state Department of Insurance (DOI) auditor that the "Rate Memo" circulating in the office matches the version signed by the actuary. Verification prevents "Internal Data Drift" where different departments use different versions of a proposed rate.

**Market Conduct Exams:** Providing verified hashes of all 50 state filings to examiners to prove 100% filing integrity and consistency.

## Third-Party Use

**State Insurance Regulators (DOI)**
**Audit Integrity:** Regulators can verify the authenticity of the actuarial signature and the specific data points (MLR, Trends) in the filing. OCR-to-hash prevents a carrier from submitting a "Optimistic" version to the regulator and a "Pessimistic" version to the rating agencies.

**Healthcare Advocacy Groups**
**Transparency:** Allowing public interest groups to verify the *actual* approved rate increases, stopping "Messaging Fraud" where a company announces a 4% increase but the verified filing shows 14% for certain segments.

**Rating Agencies (S&P / A.M. Best)**
**Solvency Review:** Verifying that the rates are "Adequate" to cover future claims, protecting against insurer insolvency.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Rate Padding" Fraud Problem**

- **Trend Inflation:** Manually editing the "Medical Cost Trend" from 5% to 8% in the PDF to justify a higher premium hike.
- **MLR Manipulation:** Hiding "Administrative Costs" as "Quality Improvement" in the text to appear compliant with the 80% rule.
- **Signature Forgery:** Forging the Enrolled Actuary's signature on a memo they didn't actually vet.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**Health Insurance Carriers.**
**Actuarial Consulting Firms:** (Milliman, Mercer, Oliver Wyman).
**State Departments of Insurance (DOI):** (As the ultimate approving authority).

## Jurisdictional Witnessing

A jurisdiction may require the issuer to retain a **witnessing firm** for regulatory compliance. The witnessing firm:

- Receives all hashes from the issuer, and any subsequent changes to the payload as they happen—which may manifest as a new hash, a status change, or even a 404 (record deleted)
- Receives structured content/metadata (key identifiers and dates)
- Does **NOT** receive plaintext or sensitive personal information
- Provides an immutable, timestamped audit trail—available to the jurisdiction on demand, to document holders/third parties during disputes, or as expert witness testimony in legal proceedings

This provides:
- **Non-repudiation:** Issuer cannot deny issuing the document
- **Timestamp proof:** Document existed at a specific time
- **Regulatory audit:** Jurisdictions can inspect the witness ledger for fraud detection
- **Resilience:** Verification works even if issuer's systems go down

**Public Blockchain (Non-Party)**

Witnessing firms may periodically commit rollups to an inexpensive public blockchain, providing an ultimate immutability guarantee. The blockchain is a "non-party"—infrastructure, not a participant in the transaction. This creates multiple verification paths:

1. **Issuer domain** — Direct check against the issuer
2. **Witnessing firm** — Independent confirmation with timestamp
3. **Public blockchain** — Decentralized trust anchor via rollup inclusion


## Competition vs. SERFF Database

| Feature | OCR-to-Hash | SERFF / State Public Search | Scanned PDF Memo |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **User Experience** | **Universal.** Scan the memo at the hearing. | **Hard.** Requires navigating complex gov search forms. | **Instant.** |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Bound to the Actuary/Insurer. | **Gov-Bound.** | **Zero.** Easily forged. |
| **Integrity** | **Binds Content.** Protects the % increase. | **Data-Only.** | **Vulnerable.** |
| **Immediacy** | **Real-time.** Shows if firm retracted opinion. | **Laggy.** Depends on gov indexing. | **Static.** |

**Why OCR wins here:** The "Hearing Reality." Rate hearings are public and contentious. Advocacy groups and the press need to trust the numbers *in the room*. OCR-to-hash turns the **Paper Actuarial Memo** into a live digital checkpoint, ensuring the public debate is based on verified, non-altered facts.
