## What is a Property Deed?

A **Deed** is the legal instrument that transfers ownership of real estate from one person (the Grantor) to another (the Grantee). It is the "Physical Proof" of who owns a piece of the earth.

In most jurisdictions, a deed is not fully effective against third parties until it is **Recorded** in the county's official land records.

**"Title Theft"** is a rapidly growing fraud where criminals forge a homeowner's signature on a "Quitclaim Deed," notarize it with a fake stamp, and record it at the county office. They then use this "Verified" (but fraudulent) record to take out massive home equity loans or even "sell" the house to an unsuspecting buyer.

OCR-to-hash binds the **Grantor/Grantee names and the Legal Description** to the County Recorder's domain. A fraudulent deed would generate a hash that doesn't exist in the county's "Verified Index," instantly alerting title companies and banks to the scam.

## Data Verified

Grantor name, Grantee name, Full Legal Description (Metes and Bounds or Lot/Block), Tax Parcel ID (APN), Consideration amount, Notary name/commission, Recording timestamp, Instrument Number.

**Document Types:**
- **Warranty Deed:** Highest protection; grantor warrants title is clear.
- **Quitclaim Deed:** Low protection; grantor transfers whatever interest they have (common in fraud).
- **Trustee's Deed:** Used in foreclosure or trust transfers.
- **Correction Deed:** Issued to fix typos in previous filings.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (the County Recorder or Registrar) and the current indexing status.

**Status Indications:**
- **Recorded** — Document is authentic and part of the official chain of title.
- **Voided/Fraud Alert** — **ALERT:** County has flagged this instrument as fraudulent or revoked by court order.
- **Amended** — Superseded by a "Correction Deed" (linked hash).
- **Pending** — Received by the county but not yet fully indexed.

## Second-Party Use

The **Property Owner (Grantee)** benefits from verification.

**Equity Protection:** Proving to a lender or a buyer that their deed is the "Verified Last-in-Chain" instrument. This stops "Title Theft" before it can happen, as the owner can set a "Watch" on their own property hash.

**Estate Planning:** Ensuring that a deed transferring a home into a family trust is verified and recorded correctly, preventing probate delays.

## Third-Party Use

**Title Insurance Companies**
**Chain of Title Integrity:** During a home sale, the title officer scans every deed in the 30-year history. "Verified by County" ensures no "Wild Deeds" or fake instruments were inserted into the records to hide a lien or steal ownership.

**Mortgage Lenders**
**Collateral Vetting:** Verifying that the person applying for a $500,000 loan is actually the **Verified Record Owner** of the property. This stops "Air Loan" fraud where scammers take out loans on properties they don't own.

**Real Estate Attorneys**
**Litigation Evidence:** In a "Quiet Title" action, providing the court with a cryptographically verified history of every transfer, making it impossible for opposing parties to present forged paper deeds.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Dirty Paper" Fraud Problem**

- **Signature Forgery:** The #1 real estate fraud. Criminals signing the owner's name on a Quitclaim deed.
- **"Wild Deeds":** Recording a deed that looks real but has no connection to the previous owner in the chain.
- **Notary Fraud:** Using a stolen or fabricated notary seal to make a fake deed look "Official."

**Issuer Types**

**County Recorders / Registrars of Deeds:** (The primary source of truth).
**Title Insurance Underwriters:** (e.g., First American, Old Republic - who host "Verified Title" mirror hashes).

## Competition vs. Blockchain (NFTs)

| Feature | OCR-to-Hash | Blockchain (NFT) | Traditional Paper |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Legal Standing** | **High.** Binds to existing laws. | **Low.** Courts don't yet recognize NFTs as deeds. | **Standard.** |
| **Accessibility** | **Universal.** Any smartphone. | **Technical.** Requires crypto-wallets. | **Visual.** |
| **Implementation** | **Cheap.** API over existing DB. | **Expensive.** Requires new legal framework. | **Manual.** |
| **Trust Anchor** | **The County.** (Elected Official). | **The Network.** (Decentralized). | **The Paper.** |

**Why OCR wins here:** The "Recorder's Counter" reality. Real estate law is 500 years old. It moves slowly. OCR-to-hash provides **"Digital Integrity for Paper Reality"**—it gives the benefits of a blockchain (immutability and verification) without requiring the world to rewrite its property laws or abandon the physical deed.
