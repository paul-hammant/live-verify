## What is Event Insurance?

If a major music festival (like Glastonbury) or a Broadway show is cancelled due to a hurricane, a pandemic, or the lead singer losing their voice, the promoter stands to lose **millions of dollars**.

**Contingency Insurance** (or Event Cancellation Insurance) covers these losses.

Promoters must show this verified proof of insurance to stadium owners and lenders before any equipment moves onto the field. Fraud is common: promoters sometimes edit an old policy to "fake" coverage for a high-risk event to get a lower venue rate.

## Data Verified

Insured entity name, event name/ID, coverage limits (Cancellation/Abandonment/Non-Appearance), specific "Key Artist" inclusions, date range of the event, geographic territory, primary endorsements (e.g., Pandemic/Communicable Disease), issuing syndicate.

**Document Types:**
- **Evidence of Insurance:** For venues and vendors.
- **Non-Appearance Rider:** Specific to celebrity/athlete availability.
- **Prize Indemnity Certificate:** (e.g., "Hole-in-One" or "Half-Court Shot" insurance).
- **Adverse Weather Policy:** Triggered by specific rainfall/wind measurements.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`beazley.com`, `hiscox.com`) and current policy standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Active** — Premium paid; event covered.
- **Cancelled** — Policy terminated (often due to non-payment or increased risk profile).
- **Claim Filed** — Event has been cancelled; claim in processing.
- **Closed** — Event completed; no claim filed.

## Second-Party Use

The **Event Promoter** benefits from verification.

**Venue Booking:** Proving to a stadium or arena owner that the $25M cancellation policy is verified active. Venues often require this proof before allowing a promoter to move equipment onto the grass.

**Talent Booking:** Proving to a major artist's agent that the "Non-Appearance" deposit is backed by a verified insurance policy from a Lloyd's syndicate.

**Sponsorship Contracts:** Assuring major sponsors (e.g., Coca-Cola or Nike) that their investment is protected even if the event is cancelled due to a hurricane or pandemic.

## Third-Party Use

**Venue Owners / Stadiums**
**Liability Discharge:** Ensuring the promoter has enough "Cancellation Cash" to pay the venue's staff and overhead if the concert is called off at the last minute.

**Reinsurers**
**Risk Aggregation:** Reinsurers can verify the digital hashes of all "Festival Policies" in a specific city to ensure they aren't over-exposed to a single weather event (e.g., a hurricane hitting Miami during Art Basel).

**Artists / Talent Agencies**
**Deposit Protection:** Verifying that the insurance covering the artist's non-appearance (which might trigger a refund of their guarantee) is legitimate.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Phantom Policy" Fraud Problem**

- **Photoshop Forgery:** Editing an old 2022 pandemic policy to read "2026" to trick a venue into allowing a high-risk event.
- **Limit Inflation:** Changing a $1M limit to a $10M limit to secure a more prestigious venue.
- **Endorsement Fabrications:** Adding a fake "Communicable Disease" endorsement to a policy that actually excludes it (a common post-COVID fraud).

**Issuer Types**

**Specialty Insurers:** (Beazley, Hiscox, Chubb).
**Lloyd's Syndicates:** (Primary market for contingency).
**MGA Specialists:** (e.g., HCC Specialty).

## Competition vs. Central Registries (Lloyd's)

| Feature | OCR-to-Hash | Lloyd's Market Database | Paper Evidence |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Integrity** | **Binds Endorsements.** Protects the "Fine Print" triggers. | **General.** Often only shows the broad policy existence. | **Zero.** Easily forged. |
| **Accessibility** | **Universal.** Any venue manager can verify. | **Restricted.** Requires Lloyd's broker access. | **Manual.** |
| **Speed** | **Instant.** Scan the paper at the loading dock. | **Slow.** Requires calling a London broker. | **Instant.** |
| **Confidentiality** | **High.** Only the specific event is verified. | **Low.** Central lists can reveal entire portfolios. | **Medium.** |

**Why OCR wins here:** The "Loading Dock" reality. In the 48 hours before a massive festival, logistics are chaotic. A site manager doesn't have time to call London to verify a broker's email. OCR-to-hash turns the **Physical Evidence of Insurance** into a live digital portal, ensuring that the show goes on (or is safely insured if it doesn't).
