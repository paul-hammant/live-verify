## What are Third-Party Verification Letters?

In high-stakes financial decisions (Mortgages, Auto Loans, Rental Screening), lenders don't trust the applicant's word. They use a **Third-Party Verifier** (e.g., The Work Number, Equifax, or a CPA) to independently confirm the applicant's income and employment status.

These letters are the "Seal of Solvency." Fraud is rampant: people create fake "CPAs" with fake websites to "verify" their own income, or they "edit" a real verification report to hide a job termination or to double their salary. Verified hashes bind the **Subject's Name, Verified Income, and Verifier's Authority** to the verifier's domain (e.g., `equifax.com` or `experian.com`).

## Data Verified

Subject name, SSN (masked), employer name, job title, employment status (Active/Inactive), date of hire, base salary, bonus/commission data, total year-to-date earnings, verifier ID, date of report.

**Document Types:**
- **Employment Verification Report:** (VOE) Standard for lending.
- **Income Verification (VOI):** Detailed 3-year history.
- **Background Check Summary:** (Linked hash) criminal/credit check.
- **CPA Certification Letter:** For self-employed individuals.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`equifax.com`, `workday.com`, `experian.com`) and the verification standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Verified / Accurate** — Data matches the verifier's live payroll link.
- **Employment Ended** — **ALERT:** The subject is no longer employed at the company.
- **Data Mismatch** — **ALERT:** The salary on the paper does not match the payroll system.
- **Revoked** — **ALERT:** Verifier has withdrawn the report (e.g., due to discovered applicant fraud).

## Second-Party Use

The **Applicant (Borrower / Tenant)** benefits from verification.

**Mortgage Approval Speed:** When applying for a loan, the borrower provides the verified hash of their "Work Number" report. The lender can instantly see **"VERIFIED SALARY: $145,000"** from a trusted third party, removing the 3-day "Manual Audit" delay and potentially securing a lower rate.

**Rental Applications:** A prospective tenant can show a verified income hash to a landlord. "Verified by Equifax" ensures the landlord that the applicant has the financial means to pay the rent, removing the need for 3 months of invasive bank statements.

## Third-Party Use

**Mortgage Underwriters / Banks**
**Zero-Trust Vetting:** Thousands of fake "CPA Letters" are submitted to banks every month. OCR-to-hash connects the underwriter directly to the verifier's domain, stopping "Income Padding" fraud and protecting the bank's loan portfolio.

**Property Managers**
**Applicant Filtering:** Instantly filtering for only verified, employment-stable candidates, reducing the risk of "Non-Payment" evictions.

**HR & Recruiting Firms**
**Candidate Vetting:** Verifying that a candidate's "Previous Title and Salary" are accurate facts before making a high-value job offer.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Phantom Verifier" Fraud Problem**

- **Verifier Spoofing:** Creating a fake company website (e.g., `verified-income-cpa.com`) to vouch for a fraudulent loan application.
- **Amount Inflation:** Changing a $45,000 verified salary to $145,000 on a PDF report.
- **Job Status Hiding:** Presenting a "Verified Report" from 6 months ago as if it were "Today's" status for a person who was recently fired.

**Issuer Types**

**National Employment Data Hubs.**
**Payroll Platform Providers (Workday, ADP).**
**Licensed CPAs / Accounting Firms.**

**Privacy Salt:** Highly Critical. Individual income data is protected by strict privacy laws (FCRA). The hash MUST be salted to prevent "Mass Income Scraping" of the workforce.

## Rationale

Third-party verification is the "Check and Balance" of the financial system. By turning these reports into verifiable digital bridges, we ensure that high-stakes credit decisions are based on the digital truth of payroll, not the creative editing of an applicant.
