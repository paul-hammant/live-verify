## Data Verified

Applicant name, fingerprint card number, notary certification, purpose (FBI, employment, licensing), notary name, notary commission number, notary seal, certification date

**Certificate Variations:** Multiple certificate types or levels may exist.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain and the responder text (e.g., "Valid ID" or "Denied").

**Status Indications:**
- **Valid** - Document verified and current
- **Expired** - Document has reached expiration
- **Revoked** - Document has been revoked or cancelled
- **Superseded** - A newer version exists

The verification response may include additional context such as issue date, expiration date, or document serial numbers.

## Second-Party Use

The document holder (subject/recipient) benefits from verification.

**Authenticity Confirmation:** Verify certificate after receipt to confirm it's genuine.

**Credential Display:** Present verified credentials to employers or clients.

**Professional Development:** Track verified certifications for career advancement.

**Compliance Documentation:** Maintain verified certificates for regulatory requirements.

**Renewal Planning:** Monitor certification status to avoid expiration.

## Third-Party Use

**Courts and Legal Professionals**

Litigation and legal proceedings:

**Evidence Authentication:** Verify documents submitted as evidence.

**Discovery Verification:** Confirm authenticity of documents in discovery.

## Verification Architecture

**The Fingerprint certifications (background checks) Fraud Problem**

Document fraud creates significant risks:

- **Fabrication:** Entirely fake documents created from scratch
- **Alteration:** Genuine documents with modified content (dates, amounts, names)
- **Impersonation:** Documents falsely claiming to be from legitimate issuers
- **Expired/Revoked Documents:** Presenting invalid documents as current

OCR-to-hash verification addresses fake and altered documents. Domain binding confirms the claimed issuer actually issued the document.

**Issuer Types**

Who issues these documents and operates verification endpoints?

**Primary Issuers:** Organizations with direct authority to issue these documents.

**Licensed Professionals:** Professionals authorized to create and certify documents.

**Government Agencies:** Federal, state, or local agencies with jurisdiction.

**Industry Bodies:** Trade associations and professional organizations.

**System Integration**

Verification integrates with relevant systems:

**Issuer Systems:** Core operational systems generate verification hashes at document creation.

**Industry Standards:** Existing data standards extended to include verification.

**Regulatory Systems:** Government databases for systematic hash receipt and oversight.

**Third-Party Platforms:** Industry portals and platforms enable verification access.

## Rationale

Prevents fake fingerprint certifications for background checks. Domain binding verifies notary commission. FBI background checks require notarized fingerprint cards. Security clearances need authenticated fingerprint submissions. Employment screening for sensitive positions. Prevents identity fraud in criminal background checks. Critical for law enforcement where fingerprint authenticity proves applicant identity.
