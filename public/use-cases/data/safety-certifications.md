## What are Safety Certifications?

For any manufactured product—especially electronics, toys, and building materials—a **Safety Certification** (like a UL Listing or a CE Mark) is the proof that the item won't catch fire, explode, or leach toxins. These certifications are issued by independent labs after rigorous testing against thousands of pages of safety codes.

These documents are the "Entry Permit" for global commerce. US Customs, Amazon, and Walmart will not sell or import a product unless it has a verified **Certificate of Compliance (CoC)**. Fraud is a massive global issue: factories in unregulated regions often place fake "UL" or "CE" labels on un-tested, dangerous products to save on testing costs. Verified hashes bind the **Product Model, Testing Standard, and Lab ID** to the certifying body's domain (e.g., `ul.com` or `intertek.com`).

## Data Verified

Certificate number, manufacturer name, factory location ID, product model name/number, specific safety standards met (e.g., UL 60950), date of issuance, expiration date (if applicable), testing lab ID, follow-up service (FUS) status, signing engineer name.

**Document Types:**
- **Certificate of Compliance (CoC):** The summary for retailers/customs.
- **Listing Report (Full):** The multi-page technical test data.
- **Factory Inspection Report:** Proof the factory itself is audited.
- **Mark Authorization:** Permission to print the "UL" or "CE" logo.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`ul.com`, `intertek.com`, `tuv.com`) and the listing standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Listed / Verified** — Product is current and in full safety compliance.
- **Withdrawn** — **CRITICAL:** The listing has been cancelled (e.g., due to failed factory audit).
- **Recalled** — **CRITICAL:** Product has a safety defect; stop use immediately.
- **Expired** — **ALERT:** The certification period has passed; re-testing required.

## Second-Party Use

The **Manufacturer / Importer** benefits from verification.

**Retailer Approval:** To get a product onto Amazon or Target, the importer provides the verified hash of their safety certificate. The retailer's "Automated Compliance Bot" scans the hash and instantly confirms the listing is real, removing the 2-week delay of manual lab-record checks.

**Insurance Underwriting:** Manufacturers can use verified hashes of their "Low-Risk" safety history to negotiate lower product liability premiums, proving their commitment to engineering standards with cryptographic certainty.

## Third-Party Use

**Customs & Border Protection (CBP)**
**Anti-Counterfeit Vetting:** In a busy port, an officer scans the label on a crate of lithium batteries. If the hash returns **"NOT FOUND"** or **"DOMAIN MISMATCH,"** they can seize the shipment immediately, stopping dangerous un-tested electronics from entering the market.

**Fire Marshals / Safety Inspectors**
**Field Integrity:** During a building inspection, the marshal scans the "Verified" stickers on the electrical panels or commercial kitchen equipment. OCR-to-hash ensures the equipment hasn't been "Fake Labeled" to hide a lack of certification.

**Amazon / E-commerce Platforms**
**Merchant Accountability:** Automatically de-listing any seller whose verified safety hash returns a **"RECALLED"** or **"WITHDRAWN"** status, protecting customers from exploding chargers or toxic toys.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Fake Label" Fraud Problem**

- **Standard Padding:** Printing a "UL Listed" logo on a product that was never tested by UL.
- **Model Masking:** Using a valid certificate for a "Safe" model to cover for a "Cheaper, Dangerous" model.
- **Lab Spoofing:** Creating a fake "CoC" from a non-existent testing lab with a fraudulent website.

**Issuer Types**

**Nationally Recognized Testing Laboratories (NRTLs) like UL, Intertek.**
**European Notified Bodies (for CE Marks).**
**National Standards Bureaus (e.g., NIST, ANSI).**

**Privacy Salt:** Low. Safety certifications are public safety data by necessity. However, individual factory IDs and production batch volumes should be salted to protect manufacturing trade secrets.

## Rationale

Product safety is the "Invisible Foundation" of modern life. By turning static labels into verifiable digital bridges, we ensure that the "Protection" on the box is backed by the professional truth of the lab, preventing fires and saving lives.
