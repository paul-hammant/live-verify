## What is a Neobank Account Confirmation?

Neo-banks (like Chime, Monzo, Revolut, N26) rarely have physical branches. When a customer opens an account, they receive a **digital confirmation PDF** (or email) listing their account details (IBAN, Routing Number, Account Number).

Customers often need to **print this PDF** to prove they have a bank account to:
1.  **Landlords:** To set up rent payments.
2.  **Embassies:** For visa applications (proof of funds).
3.  **Employers:** For direct deposit setup.

The problem? Anyone can inspect-element a PDF or email to change the numbers. A landlord has no branch to call to verify the printout.

## Data Verified

Customer Name, Address (if verified), Account Number, Routing/Sort Code, IBAN, Account Status, Date of Opening.

**Document Types:**
- **Account Confirmation Letter:** Formal proof of account existence.
- **Bank Statement:** Detailed transaction history (often requested by Visa officers).
- **Direct Deposit Form:** Pre-filled form for employers.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (e.g., `monzo.com`) and the status.

**Status Indications:**
- **Active** — Account is open and in good standing.
- **Closed** — Account has been closed (prevents using old statements).
- **Restricted** — Account frozen for investigation.

## Second-Party Use

The **Customer** benefits from verification.

**Visa Applications:** Embassies (e.g., Schengen, UK, US) require "original" bank statements. For online banks, *everything* is a printout. Verification proves the printout is authentic and not "Photoshopped."

**Rental Applications:** Landlords require proof of funds. A verified statement beats a screenshot that could easily be edited to show $50,000 instead of $500.

## Third-Party Use

**Government Agencies (Immigration)**
**Visa Officers:** Can scan the printout submitted with a visa application to confirm the applicant actually has the funds claimed, without needing to subpoena the foreign bank.

**Employers / Payroll**
**Direct Deposit Setup:** Verifying the routing/account numbers on the voided check or form prevents "payroll diversion" fraud (where hackers trick HR into changing bank details).

**Lenders**
**Income Verification:** Mortgage brokers can verify the neo-bank statements provided as proof of down payment funds.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Photoshop Banking" Fraud Problem**
Because neo-bank documents are *born digital* (PDFs), they are trivial to edit before printing. Users can change:
- **Balances:** Inflating funds for loans/visas.
- **Names:** Putting their name on someone else's statement.
- **Dates:** Making an old statement look recent.

**Issuer Types**
- **Neo-banks:** (Chime, Current, Varo, Monzo, Revolut, N26, Starling).
- **Fintech Wallets:** (PayPal, Venmo, Cash App - for balance letters).

## Competition vs. Open Banking / APIs

| Feature | OCR-to-Hash | Open Banking (Plaid/Yodlee) | App-to-App |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **User Privacy** | **High.** Verifier sees only what is printed. No login credential sharing. | **Low.** Requires sharing banking login/password with third party. | **Medium.** Requires specific app integrations. |
| **Friction** | **Low.** Scan the paper. No app install needed for verifier. | **High.** Requires user to log in and authorize data sharing. | **High.** Both sides need the app. |
| **Physical World** | **Native.** Works on the printed page at an embassy desk. | **Non-existent.** Cannot "click" a link on paper. | **Low.** Requires digital handshake. |
| **Cost** | **Zero/Low.** Static web hosting. | **High.** Aggregators charge per connection. | **High.** Development cost. |

**Why OCR wins here:**
For **ad-hoc, low-tech interactions** (like handing a paper to a landlord or a visa officer), Open Banking is overkill and technically difficult. OCR-to-hash bridges the gap: it makes the *paper* smart without forcing the landlord to integrate with Plaid.
