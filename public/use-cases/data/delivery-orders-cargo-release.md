## What is a Delivery Order?

When a shipping container arrives at a port, the terminal operator won't just give it to any trucker. They need a **Delivery Order (DO)**.

This is the "Golden Ticket" that authorizes the release of the cargo. It proves:
1.  **Freight is Paid:** The ship line has been settled.
2.  **Customs is Cleared:** The government has released the goods.
3.  **The Bearer is Right:** The trucker has the authority to take it.

Cargo theft via "Fictitious Pickup" is a huge problem. Thieves use forged paper DOs to trick port clerks into giving them $200,000 containers. Verified hashes allow the port to check the DO against the broker's domain in seconds, stopping theft at the gate.

## Data Verified

Delivery Order (DO) number, Consignee name, Trucking company (if specified), Container ID, Bill of Lading (B/L) number, Port Terminal ID, freight payment status, customs clearance status, expiration date (Last Free Day), issuing broker/carrier.

**Document Types:**
- **Delivery Order (DO):** Authorization to release cargo from the terminal.
- **Steamship Line Release:** Proving the ocean freight is paid.
- **Customs Release:** (Form 3461) Proving the government has released the goods.
- **Gate Pass:** Handed to the driver for physical exit.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (the Customs Broker or Carrier) and the release standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Released** — All holds cleared; cargo authorized for pickup.
- **Freight Hold** — **ALERT:** Ocean freight not yet paid; do not release.
- **Customs Hold** — Government has blocked the release.
- **Picked Up** — Cargo has already left the terminal (fraud detection).

## Second-Party Use

**The Trucker (Driver)** benefits from verification.

**Terminal Access:** Proving to the gate clerk that the "Delivery Order" on their tablet is 100% authentic and that all freight/customs hurdles are cleared. This prevents the driver from being "Turned Away" at the gate, which saves hours of idling and fuel.

**Liability Protection:** Confirming the "Last Free Day" is verified, ensuring the trucker won't be hit with unexpected "Demurrage" charges at the gate.

## Third-Party Use

**Terminal Operators (Stevedores)**
**Anti-Theft:** Cargo theft via "Fictitious Pickup" is a billion-dollar problem. Thieves use forged paper DOs to trick gate clerks into releasing containers. OCR-to-hash allows the clerk to verify the order against the broker's domain, stopping the theft at the gate.

**Customs Brokers**
**Supply Chain Visibility:** Remotely monitoring the "Verified Status" of their issued DOs to see exactly when the cargo was picked up by the trucker.

**Marine Insurers**
**Risk Mitigation:** Ensuring that high-value cargo is only released to verified, authorized carriers.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Fake Release" Fraud Problem**

- **Ghost Pickups:** Thieves creating a fake "Delivery Order" for a $200,000 container of electronics, posing as a legitimate trucking company.
- **Hold Removal:** Editing a PDF to remove a "Freight Hold" or "Customs Hold" notation to trick the terminal into releasing cargo before payment.
- **Date Alteration:** Changing the "Last Free Day" to avoid paying storage fees to the terminal.

**Issuer Types**

**Customs Brokers:** (e.g., Expeditors, Flexport, K+N).
**Steamship Lines:** (e.g., Maersk, MSC).
**Terminal Operating Systems (TOS).**

## Competition vs. Port Community Systems (PCS)

| Feature | OCR-to-Hash | Port Portal / PCS | Paper Delivery Order |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Bound to the Broker. | **System-Bound.** Trust the Port's IT. | **Zero.** Easily forged. |
| **User Access** | **Universal.** Any trucker with a phone. | **Restricted.** Requires complex EDI/Portal logins. | **Instant.** |
| **Integrity** | **Binds Content.** Proves the *Container #*. | **Data-Only.** Doesn't protect the paper. | **Vulnerable.** |
| **Offline Proof** | **Strong.** The paper is the anchor. | **None.** Requires server access. | **Medium.** |

**Why OCR wins here:** The "Gate Clerk" reality. Gate operations are high-pressure and fast. Clerks often handle hundreds of trucks an hour. They don't have time to cross-reference multiple slow portals. OCR-to-hash turns the **Trucker's Document** into a live, high-speed trust token that provides "Port-Grade" security in seconds.
