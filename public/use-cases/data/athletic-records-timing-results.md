## Data Verified

Athlete name, date of birth, nationality, event name and discipline, time/distance/score achieved, competition name and location, competition date, competition level (local/national/world), timing authority or federation, officials' names, conditions (wind speed, altitude for relevant events), equipment verification status, any record designations.

**Document Types:**
- **Official Results Certificates:** Competition results documentation
- **Record Certificates:** Recognition of record-breaking performances
- **Timing Slips:** Official timing system output
- **Performance Verification Letters:** Federation confirmation of performances
- **Ranking Certificates:** Position in national/world rankings
- **Age Group Records:** Age-graded performance documentation
- **Personal Best Certificates:** Athlete's career-best recognition

**Precision Requirements:** Athletic timing can be to 1/100th or 1/1000th of a second. OCR must accurately capture these precise measurements—a misread "1" vs "7" could falsely claim a world record.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (the federation, timing authority, or competition organizer) and the responder text.

**Status Indications:**
- **Verified** - Performance confirmed in federation records
- **Ratified** - Record officially ratified by governing body
- **Pending Ratification** - Record awaiting official confirmation
- **Invalidated** - Performance disqualified (doping, technical violation)
- **Superseded** - Record has since been broken

**Record Status:** Verification indicates record standing: "Verified - Current World Record" or "Verified - Former World Record (broken [date])."

## Verification Architecture

**The Athletic Record Fraud Problem**

Fabricated athletic credentials undermine sport integrity:

- **Invented Records:** Entirely fabricated performance claims
- **Altered Times/Distances:** Genuine results with improved numbers
- **Competition Fraud:** Results from non-existent competitions
- **Timing Manipulation:** Tampered timing equipment or documentation
- **Age Fraud:** Performances attributed to wrong age category
- **Impersonation:** Another athlete's results claimed as own

OCR-to-hash addresses fabrication and alteration. Federation database cross-reference confirms performance authenticity.

**Timing Authorities and Federations as Issuers**

Multiple organizations verify athletic performances:

**World Athletics:** International track and field federation.

**National Federations:** USA Track & Field, British Athletics, etc.

**Timing Companies:** Swiss Timing, Omega, TAG Heuer.

**Event Organizers:** Major marathon organizers, championship hosts.

**Age-Group Organizations:** Masters Athletics, youth federations.

Each operates verification endpoints for performances under their jurisdiction.

**Timing Technology Integration**

Modern timing systems:

**Fully Automatic Timing (FAT):** Photo-finish camera systems.

**Transponder Timing:** Chip timing for road races.

**Hand Timing:** Manual timing with specified corrections.

**GPS/Motion Capture:** Emerging technologies for some events.

**Wind Gauges:** Automatic wind measurement for sprints/jumps.

Verification could indicate timing method: "Verified - FAT timing, wind legal (+1.2 m/s)."

**Record Ratification Process**

Records require formal ratification:

**Technical Requirements:** Certified equipment, officials, facilities.

**Anti-Doping Compliance:** Clean doping test required.

**Wind Legal:** Within permitted wind assistance limits.

**Documentation:** Official forms and submissions.

**Review Period:** Time for challenges or additional verification.

Verification status distinguishes "pending ratification" from "ratified."

Context affecting performances:

**Altitude:** High-altitude performances (aided for some events).

**Wind:** Assistance or resistance in sprints and jumps.

**Temperature:** Extreme conditions affecting performance.

**Course Certification:** Verified distance for road races.

Verification may note conditions: "Verified - altitude-assisted (2,240m), not eligible for sea-level record."

**Anti-Doping Integration**

**Testing Records:** Performances linked to doping control.

**Biological Passport:** Longitudinal monitoring data.

**Whereabouts Compliance:** Availability for out-of-competition testing.

**Retroactive Analysis:** Stored samples can be retested.
