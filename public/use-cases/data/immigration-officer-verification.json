Domain binding verifies government agency (cbp.gov, ice.gov, border-agency.gov). Prevents fake immigration officer extortion scams (criminals impersonating ICE/CBP to extort money from immigrants, threaten deportation unless 'fines' paid). Critical for immigrant communities targeted by fraud. Enhances accountability for legitimate immigration enforcement."
