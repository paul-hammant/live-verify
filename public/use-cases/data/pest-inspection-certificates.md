## What is a Pest Inspection Certificate?

In the real estate world, the **Wood Destroying Insect (WDI)** report (commonly called a "Termite Certificate") is a critical closing document. It is a formal certification by a licensed inspector stating whether a house has active infestations or past structural damage from termites, carpenter ants, or beetles.

Because a "Positive" finding can kill a home sale or require a $5,000 treatment, these reports are primary targets for fraud. Sellers often "edit" a report to turn "Active Infestation" into "None Found," or they "delete" a section that mentions $10,000 in hidden structural damage. Verified hashes bind the **Property Address, Inspection Findings, and Inspector's License** to the inspection firm's or the state board's domain (e.g., `orkin.com` or `pest-registry.gov`).

## Data Verified

Report ID, property address, owner name (optional/masked), buyer name, inspection date, active infestation status (Yes/No), previous damage location/severity, treatment recommendations, inspector name/license, company name, date of signature.

**Document Types:**
- **WDI Inspection Report:** (Form NPMA-33) The industry standard.
- **Treatment Certificate:** Proof that a house was recently "Tented" or treated.
- **Termite Bond:** (Linked hash) the ongoing maintenance guarantee.
- **Wood Infestation Letter:** A simplified summary for some lenders.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`orkin.com`, `terminix.com`, `state-ag-board.gov`) and the report standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Verified / Clear** — Report matches the original digital record; no active bugs.
- **Treatment Required** — **ALERT:** The original report recommended immediate chemical treatment.
- **Damage Flagged** — **ALERT:** Structural issues were identified that require a contractor audit.
- **Expired** — **ALERT:** Report is more than 30 days old; re-inspection required for closing.

## Second-Party Use

The **Home Seller / Real Estate Agent** benefits from verification.

**Closing Speed:** Before a bank releases a $500,000 mortgage, the underwriter scans the seller's WDI hash. "Verified by Orkin" ensures the bank that the house isn't "Bug Infested," removing the 3-day "Manual Report Vetting" delay and allowing the deal to close on schedule.

**Disclosure Shield:** A seller can use the verified hash to prove exactly what they disclosed to the buyer at the time of sale, defending against a "Hidden Damage" lawsuit filed 2 years later.

## Third-Party Use

**Mortgage Lenders / Underwriters**
**Collateral Risk Audit:** Thousands of "Edited" PDF reports are submitted to banks every month. OCR-to-hash connects the underwriter directly to the inspection firm's domain, stopping "Termite Fraud" at the source and protecting the bank's property lien.

**Home Buyers (The Public)**
**Due Diligence:** A potential buyer can scan the WDI hash provided in the "Listing Packet" before they even make an offer. This ensures the "Clean" report isn't a fabrication, protecting them from buying a "Money Pit" with structural rot.

**Title and Escrow Companies**
**Closing Audit:** Verifying that the WDI report in the file is the final, un-altered version required by the lender's instructions.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Finding Scrubbing" Fraud Problem**

- **Infestation Masking:** Changing an "Active" checkbox to "None" on a PDF to hide a termite problem.
- **Damage Deletion:** Removing a page of the report that shows a photo of a rotted sill plate.
- **License Mimicry:** Creating a fake report using a reputable inspector's name and license number from a public board.

**Issuer Types**

**National Pest Control Firms.**
**Independent Licensed Inspectors.**
**State Departments of Agriculture (Licensing Boards).**

**Privacy Salt:** Essential. Specific property defect details and home addresses are sensitive. The hash must be salted to prevent "Neighborhood Blight Mapping" by data brokers or speculators.

## Rationale

Pest inspection is the "Structural Integrity" audit of a home. By turning static reports into verifiable digital bridges, we protect the buyer's investment and the lender's collateral, ensuring that "Clear" really means "No Bugs."
