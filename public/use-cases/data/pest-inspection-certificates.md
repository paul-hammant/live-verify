## What is a Termite Certificate?

Before you can buy or sell a house, the bank often requires a **Wood Destroying Insect (WDI)** report, commonly called a "Termite Certificate."

It is the official proof from a licensed inspector that the house isn't being eaten by bugs.

Fraud is common in real estate: a seller might edit a PDF report to hide that the inspector found "Active Termites" in the garage. Verified hashes protect the **inspector's true findings**, ensuring the bank doesn't lend $500,000 on a house with structural bug damage.

## Verification Architecture

**The Pest inspection certificates Fraud Problem**

Document fraud creates significant risks:

- **Fabrication:** Entirely fake documents created from scratch
- **Alteration:** Genuine documents with modified content (dates, amounts, names)
- **Impersonation:** Documents falsely claiming to be from legitimate issuers
- **Expired/Revoked Documents:** Presenting invalid documents as current

OCR-to-hash verification addresses fake and altered documents. Domain binding confirms the claimed issuer actually issued the document.

**Issuer Types**

Who issues these documents and operates verification endpoints?

**Government Entities:** Counties, cities, and special districts maintain property records.

**Title Companies:** Title insurers and escrow companies for transaction documents.

**Lending Institutions:** Banks and mortgage companies for loan documents.

**Appraisal Firms:** Licensed appraisers for property valuations.

**System Integration**

Real estate verification connects to property systems:

**Recording Systems:** County recorder systems for property document registration.

**MLS Integration:** Multiple listing services for property documentation.

**Title Plants:** Title companies maintain verification for title searches.

**E-Recording:** Electronic recording systems generate verification at recording.

## Rationale

Domain binding verifies pest control company. Certificate format suitable for OCR. Warranty verification. Liability records.
