## What is a Certificate of Origin?

A **Certificate of Origin (CO)** is the "Nationality Passport" for a shipment of goods. It is issued by a **Chamber of Commerce** and certifies that the products (microprocessors, precision gears, electronics, etc.) were truly "Born" in a specific country.

It's not just for geography—it's for **Tariffs**. If a company ships microprocessors from the USA to South Korea, they might pay 0% duty (tax) if they have a verified CO. If they don't have one, they might pay 10% or more. For a $1M shipment, a verified CO can save $50,000 in duties.

**The Fraud Problem:** Fraudsters often "launder" products—shipping goods from a high-tax country (like China) to a neutral country (like Vietnam) and creating a fake CO to avoid paying US or EU duties. Because these documents save companies millions in "Preferential Tariffs," they are high-value targets for forgery. Scammers create fake Chamber stamps and letterheads to trick customs agents into allowing duty-free entry for sanctioned or high-tariff goods.

## Data Verified

Exporter name and location, Consignee name and location, specific Country of Origin, detailed description of goods, Harmonized System (HS) Codes, quantity/weight, Certificate ID number, certifying authority (Chamber name and location), date of certification.

**Document Types:**
- **Generic Certificate of Origin:** For countries without a specific FTA; non-preferential (quota monitoring, general trade).
- **Preferential CO:** Used for Free Trade Agreements (USMCA, CPTPP, bilateral FTAs) to get 0% or reduced duty.
- **GSP Certificate (Form A):** For preferential treatment for developing nations under Generalized System of Preferences.
- **Self-Certification:** Form filled out by the exporter (requires domain binding to the exporting company).

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`uschamber.com`, `iccwbo.org`) and current certificate status.

**Status Indications:**
- **Verified** — Certificate is legitimate and recorded in the Chamber's official ledger; active and valid.
- **Revoked** — Exporter found to have misrepresented origin; certificate actively cancelled.
- **Amended** — Original certificate updated (e.g., due to quantity correction, correction of HS code).
- **Invalid** — Serial number mismatch; certificate rejected by customs.
- **Void** — Certificate has been cancelled (e.g., due to trade dispute, fraud investigation).
- **Superseded** — Replaced by a corrected or reissued certificate.
- **Alert** — Associated with a known "Origin Fraud" scheme or sanctioned trader.

## Second-Party Use

The **Exporter** benefits from verification.

**Tariff Exemption:** Proving to foreign customs that the high-value electronics are US-origin, qualifying for 0% duty under a trade agreement. Verification prevents "Customs Holds" that can delay supply chains for weeks.

**Fast Customs Clearance:** Proving to Japanese/EU/Canadian customs that goods are truly UK/US/Korean origin. Verification prevents goods from being held at the port for 2 weeks while customs waits for a physical letter from the Chamber.

**Tariff Savings:** Proving eligibility for preferential tariff rates under FTAs. For a $1M shipment, savings can exceed $50,000.

**Brand Protection:** Proving the "Country of Manufacture" to consumers and retailers, protecting the "Made in USA," "Made in UK," or "Swiss Made" premium.

## Third-Party Use

**Customs Authorities (CBP, HMRC, KCS, etc.)**
**Compliance Enforcement:** Instantly verifying that the "Country of Origin" on the paper invoice matches the official Chamber of Commerce record. This stops "Tariff Engineering" where high-tariff goods are mislabeled as lower-tariff origins.

**Anti-Fraud Enforcement:** Scanning the verification link instantly proves the Chamber of Commerce actually vouches for the origin claim, catching fake chambers and forged certificates.

**Freight Forwarders**
**Documentation Vetting:** Verifying the CO before the ship departs to ensure all export paperwork is compliant, preventing port rejections/fines at the destination.

**Risk Management:** Verifying the CO before loading the ship to ensure they won't be liable for "Origin Fraud" charges at the destination.

**Trade Finance Banks**
**Documentary Compliance:** Banks paying out on Letters of Credit verify the CO to ensure it hasn't been altered to bypass trade sanctions or quotas. Verification proves the document is authentic.

**Procurement Teams**
**Sourcing Transparency:** Large corporations (e.g., Apple, BMW, SpaceX) can verify the origin claims of their tier-2 and tier-3 suppliers to ensure compliance with ethical sourcing and trade laws.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Origin Laundering" Fraud Problem**

- **Transshipment Fraud:** Shipping goods from a high-tariff country (e.g., China) to a low-tariff neutral country (Vietnam), then creating a fake "Vietnam Origin" certificate to enter the US/EU duty-free.
- **HS Code Tampering:** Editing the HS code on the paper CO to a category with lower taxes.
- **Fake Stamps:** Forging the physical rubber stamp of a legitimate Chamber of Commerce.
- **Fabricated Chambers:** Creating fake "Chamber of Commerce" websites and domains to "verify" fake certificates.
- **Duplicate COs:** Using one legitimate CO for multiple shipments of the same goods.

**Issuer Types**

- **Chambers of Commerce:** Primary issuers for Non-Preferential and Preferential COs (most countries have one per major city/region).
- **Government Trade Ministries:** Some nations issue COs directly via trade/commerce departments.
- **Customs Agencies:** Export/Import authorities that certify origin (CBP, HMRC).

## Competition vs. Blockchain (TradeLens)

| Feature | OCR-to-Hash | TradeLens / GSBN | Paper COI |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Bound to the local Chamber. | **Consensus-Bound.** Trust the network. | **Zero.** Easily forged. |
| **Adoption** | **High.** Works with existing paper/PDF docs. | **Low.** Requires every party to join the blockchain. | **Universal.** |
| **Integrity** | **Binds Content.** Proves the *Country* matches. | **Data-Only.** | **Vulnerable.** |
| **Cost** | **Low.** Standard web infra. | **Very High.** Seven-figure implementation costs. | **None.** |

**Why OCR wins here:** Ease of Entry. While "Global Trade Blockchains" are the future, most of the world's trade still runs on paper. OCR-to-hash provides **Blockchain-level security** for today's paper-based reality, allowing any small-town Chamber of Commerce to offer cryptographic verification for just a few dollars a month in hosting costs.

## Competition vs. eCO (Electronic Registry)

| Feature | OCR-to-Hash | eCO Registry (ICC) | Paper Certificate |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Field Access** | **Instant.** Scan the paper at the border gate. | **Difficult.** Requires customs officers to have specific registry logins. | **Instant.** |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Trust the local Chamber domain. | **Centralized.** Trust the ICC global platform. | **Visual.** Very easy to forge stamps. |
| **Connectivity** | **Strong.** Works even if the global ICC hub is down. | **Fragile.** Single point of failure if the ICC system is offline. | **Offline.** |
| **Integrity** | **Binds Content.** Proves the *Country* matches the chamber record. | **Data-Only.** Doesn't verify the actual paper. | **Zero.** |

**Why OCR wins here:** Decentralization. International trade is built on thousands of independent local Chambers of Commerce. It is impossible to get every small chamber in the world on a single "Global IT Platform." OCR-to-hash allows every chamber to remain independent while providing a **universal digital overlay** for their paper certificates, providing the best of both worlds—local autonomy and global verification.
