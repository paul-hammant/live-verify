## What is a Private Security License?

A **Private Security License** (commonly known as a "Guard Card") is the official state credential that allows an individual to work as a security professional.

It proves that the holder has passed a criminal background check (usually via the FBI/DOJ) and completed mandatory training in the use of force, power to arrest, and emergency response.

**"Credential Swapping"** is a major safety risk: an unlicensed individual might use a friend's physical card to gain access to a high-security facility or sensitive event. **Armed Guards** present even higher risks; a guard whose firearms qualification has expired may still be carrying a weapon illegally.

OCR-to-hash binds the **Guard's name, License Number, and Firearms Qualifications** to the state regulatory board's domain. A client or police officer can instantly verify that the guard standing before them is **Active, Vetted, and Qualified** to carry the weapons they are currently using.

## Data Verified

Licensee Name, Date of Birth (partial), License Number, Registration Type (Armed/Unarmed), Specific Qualifications (Firearms, Baton, Pepper Spray), Expiration Date, Background Check Status, Training Revision ID.

**Document Types:**
- **Security Guard Registration (Guard Card):** The primary ID card.
- **Firearms Permit:** Required for armed roles.
- **Training Completion Certificate:** Verification of specific skill hours.
- **Business License:** For the security firm itself.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (e.g., `securityboard.gov`, `dps.state.tx.us`) and the current standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Active** — Guard is fully authorized and vetted.
- **Firearm Restricted** — **ALERT:** Guard is authorized for security work but *not* authorized to carry a weapon.
- **Suspended/Revoked** — **ALERT:** License pulled due to misconduct or training failure.
- **Expired** — Background check or training is out of date.

## Second-Party Use

The **Security Professional (Guard)** benefits from verification.

**Job Efficiency:** Speeding up access to "High Value" sites. When a guard arrives for a shift at a jewelry exchange or a data center, the site manager can verify their armed status in 5 seconds via the hash, bypassing the 30-minute manual "Call the Office" vetting process.

**Incident Accountability:** If a guard is involved in a use-of-force incident, the verified hash provides an immediate record that they were operating with valid, active legal authority at that exact timestamp.

## Third-Party Use

**Building Managers / Venue Promoters**
**Vetting Contractors:** Before a major event, the promoter scans the lanyards of the 50 "Sub-contracted" guards. Verification ensures the security firm didn't hire "Un-vetted Temp Labor" to fill the gaps, which is a major insurance and safety liability.

**Police Officers**
**Field Integrity:** During a traffic stop or a patrol check, an officer scans the guard's badge. Verification confirms the "Armed" status isn't a fake PDF created to hide an illegal concealed weapon.

**Insurance Underwriters**
**Risk Management:** Verifying that a client's security staff is 100% compliant with state licensing before binding a high-limit general liability policy.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Phantom Guard" Fraud Problem**

- **Weapon Qualification Forgery:** Editing a "Firearms Qualified" line on a PDF to allow a guard to work higher-paying armed shifts without taking the required range tests.
- **Status Concealment:** Terminated guards keeping their physical cards to gain access to apartments or businesses where they were formerly employed.
- **Name Swapping:** Unlicensed individuals with criminal records using a "Clean" friend's Guard Card to get hired at a security firm.

**Issuer Types**

**State Departments of Public Safety (DPS).**
**State Bureaus of Security and Investigative Services (BSIS).**
**National Security Accreditation Bodies.**

## Competition vs. Physical ID Cards

| Feature | OCR-to-Hash | Holographic Card | Central Registry Lookup |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Bound to the State Gov. | **Physical.** Trust the printer. | **Database.** High trust but manual. |
| **Integrity** | **Binds Quals.** Protects the Armed status. | **Zero.** Doesn't protect the text. | **Data-Only.** |
| **Speed** | **Instant.** 5-second scan at the door. | **N/A.** Just looking. | **Slow.** Requires typing 10-digit ID. |
| **Hardware** | **Universal.** Any smartphone camera. | **Human Eye.** | **Technical.** Requires laptop/stable 5G. |

**Why OCR wins here:** The "Night-Shift" reality. Bouncers and site managers often work in dark, high-pressure environments when government offices are closed. OCR-to-hash turns the **Physical Guard Card** into a live, trusted safety link, ensuring that the person "Protecting the Building" is verified safe at the exact point of risk.
