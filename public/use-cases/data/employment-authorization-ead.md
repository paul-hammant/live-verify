## What is a Work Permit (EAD)?

An **Employment Authorization Document (EAD)** is the ID card issued by the US government giving a non-citizen the legal right to work.

For a business owner, this card is high-stakes. If they hire someone with a fake card, they can be fined thousands of dollars. The problem? High-quality fakes are everywhere.

OCR-to-hash turns the **Physical Card** into a live link to the USCIS database. This allows a small business owner to see if the card has been "Revoked" (e.g., if the person's visa was cancelled) in seconds, without needing expensive government software.

## Data Verified

Full name, USCIS number (A-Number), Category code (e.g., C03, C08, C09), Card serial number, effective date, expiration date, photograph (via hash), fingerprint status (hash), issuing office.

**Document Types:**
- **Employment Authorization Document (EAD):** (Form I-766).
- **Extension Notice (I-797):** Proving the 180/540-day automatic extension.
- **Grant of Asylum / Withholding:** (Linked document hash).

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`uscis.gov`) and real-time work eligibility status.

**Status Indications:**
- **Authorized** — Bearer is legally eligible to work in the U.S.
- **Pending Renewal** — Application filed; automatic extension active.
- **Revoked** — Authorization terminated (e.g., underlying case denied).
- **Expired** — No longer eligible; renewal required.

## Second-Party Use

The **Employee (Authorized Worker)** benefits from verification.

**Hiring Efficiency:** Proving to an HR manager that their "Category C08" card is legitimate and hasn't been "Revoked" by the government. A verified card removes the employer's fear of "I-9 Audit" fines, making the worker much more hireable.

**Bank Account Opening:** Proving legal status to a bank to comply with "Know Your Customer" (KYC) rules for individuals without a Green Card or Social Security Number.

## Third-Party Use

**Employers (HR Managers)**
**I-9 Compliance:** Instantly confirming that the EAD isn't a "High-Quality Forgery." Standard cards are easily bought on the black market; OCR-to-hash connects the manager directly to the USCIS record in seconds.

**Social Security Administration**
**SSN Issuance:** Verifying the work authorization before assigning an SSN.

**State DMVs**
**Driver's Licensing:** Verifying legal presence for non-immigrant driver's licenses (Real ID).

## Verification Architecture

**The "High-End Forgery" Fraud Problem**

- **Ghost Documents:** Fraudsters using high-end printers to create EAD cards for people who never applied for status.
- **Revocation Hiding:** A worker whose asylum claim was denied (revoking their EAD) keeping the physical card to trick a new employer.
- **Category Tampering:** Changing a "Student" (Restricted) category to an "Asylum" (Unrestricted) category.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS):** The sole issuer.
**DHS SAVE System:** (The backend source of truth).

**Privacy Salt:** ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL. Immigration data is a high-value target for identity theft. The hash MUST be salted to prevent "Guess-and-Check" attacks to find specific immigrants.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing

A jurisdiction may require the issuer to retain a **witnessing firm** for regulatory compliance. The witnessing firm:

- Receives all hashes from the issuer, and any subsequent changes to the payload as they happen—which may manifest as a new hash, a status change, or even a 404 (record deleted)
- Receives structured content/metadata (key identifiers and dates)
- Does **NOT** receive plaintext or sensitive personal information
- Provides an immutable, timestamped audit trail—available to the jurisdiction on demand, to document holders/third parties during disputes, or as expert witness testimony in legal proceedings

This provides:
- **Non-repudiation:** Issuer cannot deny issuing the document
- **Timestamp proof:** Document existed at a specific time
- **Regulatory audit:** Jurisdictions can inspect the witness ledger for fraud detection
- **Resilience:** Verification works even if issuer's systems go down

**Public Blockchain (Non-Party)**

Witnessing firms may periodically commit rollups to an inexpensive public blockchain, providing an ultimate immutability guarantee. The blockchain is a "non-party"—infrastructure, not a participant in the transaction. This creates multiple verification paths:

1. **Issuer domain** — Direct check against the issuer
2. **Witnessing firm** — Independent confirmation with timestamp
3. **Public blockchain** — Decentralized trust anchor via rollup inclusion


## Competition vs. E-Verify / SAVE

| Feature | OCR-to-Hash | E-Verify (Employer System) | Physical EAD Card |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Bound to `uscis.gov`. | **Direct DB Access.** High trust. | **Mechanical.** Prone to forgery. |
| **User Access** | **Open.** Small businesses can verify. | **Restricted.** Requires federal registration and training. | **Manual.** |
| **Speed** | **Instant.** 5-second scan. | **Slow.** Often flags for "Manual Review" taking days. | **Instant.** |
| **Privacy** | **High.** Verified at the point of use. | **Low.** Data resides in a federal monitoring system. | **N/A.** |

**Why OCR wins here:** The "Small Employer" reality. Millions of small businesses (landscapers, restaurants, households) do not use E-Verify because it is complex and invasive. They rely on "Looking at the card." OCR-to-hash allows **every employer** to have "E-Verify Level" trust using only their phone camera, stopping EAD fraud at the scale of the entire economy.
