## What is University Accreditation?

In most countries, the government doesn't "Grade" universities. Instead, private non-profit boards (**Accreditors**) visit the campus to verify that the school meets high standards for faculty, curriculum, and financial stability.

**Regional Accreditation** is the "Gold Standard" of higher education. Without it:
1.  **Degrees** are often ignored by major employers.
2.  **Credits** won't transfer to other universities.
3.  **Federal Funding** (like Pell Grants) cannot be used by the institution.

**"Accreditation Fraud"** is the primary tool used by "Diploma Mills." These fake schools create realistic-looking "Certificates of Accreditation" from non-existent boards like the "International Council for Academic Excellence" to trick students into paying for worthless degrees. Verified hashes bind the **Institution's name, the Accrediting Body, and the Review Dates** to the board's official domain.

## Data Verified

Institution name, Accrediting body ID, Accreditation status, Date of last review, Date of next evaluation, Level of accreditation (Regional/National), Specific campus locations included, Regulatory recognition status.

**Document Types:**
- **Certificate of Accreditation:** The formal trophy displayed in the lobby.
- **Statement of Accreditation Status (SAS):** The legal summary for regulators.
- **Action Letter:** Detailing specific findings and requirements.
- **Grant of Candidacy:** For schools seeking future accreditation.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`msche.org`, `hlcommission.org`) and current standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Accredited** — Institution meets all standards and is in good standing.
- **Probation** — **ALERT:** Significant deficiencies found; status at risk.
- **Show-Cause** — Final warning before withdrawal of accreditation.
- **Resigned/Withdrawn** — Institution is no longer accredited.

## Second-Party Use

The **University / College** benefits from verification.

**Federal Funding Compliance:** Proving to the U.S. Dept of Education that the institution is "Verified Accredited," ensuring no disruption in student loan/grant disbursements.

**Global Partnerships:** Proving institutional legitimacy to foreign universities during the establishment of "Study Abroad" programs or joint degrees.

## Third-Party Use

**Employers (HR Departments)**
**Credential Vetting:** Before hiring an executive with a "PhD in Economics," the recruiter scans the university's accreditation hash. Verification stops "Ivy League" fraud where candidates buy degrees from un-vetted, fake universities.

**Graduate School Registrars**
**Transfer Admissions:** Instantly verifying the accreditation of an applicant's undergraduate school. If the school isn't "Regional Accredited," the credits won't transfer. Verification prevents "Diploma Mill" graduates from sneaking into legitimate PhD programs.

**Financial Aid Auditors**
**Due Diligence:** Ensuring that tax-payer funds are only flowing to legitimate, verified institutions.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Fake Board" Fraud Problem**

- **Accreditor Spoofing:** Fake universities creating fake "Accreditation Boards" with professional-looking websites to "verify" their own worthless degrees.
- **Status Misrepresentation:** A school whose accreditation was revoked years ago continuing to display an old certificate to keep collecting tuition.
- **Archival Hiding:** Hiding a "Probation" status by presenting a clean, older version of the certificate.

**Issuer Types**

**Regional Accreditors:** (MSCHE, HLC, SACSCOC, WSCUC).
**National Faith-Related Accreditors.**
**Specialized Program Accreditors:** (e.g., ABET for engineering, AACSB for business).

## Competition vs. CHEA Database

| Feature | OCR-to-Hash | CHEA / DAPIP Database | Scanned PDF |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Bound to the Board. | **Gov-Bound.** Bound to the US Gov. | **Zero.** Easily forged. |
| **Speed** | **Instant.** Scan the paper on the wall. | **Slow.** Requires property search and navigation. | **Instant.** |
| **Integrity** | **Binds Certificate.** Proves the *paper* matches. | **Data-Only.** Doesn't protect against forged certificates. | **Vulnerable.** |
| **Alerting** | **Active.** Can show "PROBATION" in red. | **Passive.** | **Hidden.** |

**Why OCR wins here:** The "Lobby Entrance" reality. Parents and students decide to trust a school while standing in the lobby. They aren't going to search the federal DAPIP database on their phones. OCR-to-hash turns the **Institutional Trophy** into a **Digital Truth**, ensuring that the prestige of the certificate matches the reality of its accreditation.
