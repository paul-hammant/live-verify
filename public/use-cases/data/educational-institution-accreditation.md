## Data Verified

Institution name, accrediting body (e.g., MSCHE, SACSCOC), accreditation status (Accredited/Probation), date of last review, date of next evaluation, geographic jurisdiction, level of accreditation (Regional/National/Specialized).

**Document Types:**
- **Certificate of Accreditation:** The "Wall Diploma" for the President's office.
- **Statement of Accreditation Status (SAS):** 1-page summary extract.
- **Grant of Re-accreditation:** Formal notification letter.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`msche.org`, `hlcommission.org`) and current standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Accredited** — Institution meets all standards and is in good standing.
- **Probation** — **ALERT:** Significant deficiencies found; status at risk.
- **Show-Cause** — Final warning before withdrawal of accreditation.
- **Resigned/Withdrawn** — Institution is no longer accredited.

## Second-Party Use

The **University / College** benefits from verification.

**Federal Funding:** Proving to the U.S. Dept of Education that they are "Verified Accredited," which is a mandatory prerequisite for receiving Title IV Financial Aid (billions of dollars in loans/grants).

**Student Confidence:** Displaying the "Verified by MSCHE" badge on their website and in the admissions office to reassure prospective students that their degrees will be recognized by employers and other universities.

## Third-Party Use

**Graduate School Registrars**
**Transfer Admissions:** Instantly verifying the accreditation of an applicant's undergraduate school. If the school isn't "Regional Accredited," the credits won't transfer. Verification stops "Diploma Mill" graduates from sneaking into legitimate PhD programs.

**Employers (HR Departments)**
**Credential Vetting:** Ensuring that a job candidate's degree comes from a verified, legitimate institution and not a fake "Accredited" school with a similar name.

**State Licensing Boards**
**Professional Standards:** Verifying that a candidate's university was accredited for their specific profession (e.g., Nursing or Engineering) before granting a state license.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Diploma Mill" Fraud Problem**

- **Accreditor Spoofing:** Fake universities creating fake "Accreditation Boards" with professional-looking websites to "verify" their own worthless degrees.
- **Status Misrepresentation:** A school whose accreditation was revoked years ago continuing to display an old certificate to keep collecting tuition.
- **Name Hijacking:** Using the name of a real, defunct university to launch a new, unaccredited online school.

**Issuer Types**

**Regional Accreditors:** (MSCHE, HLC, SACSCOC, WSCUC).
**National Faith-Related Accreditors.**
**Program-Specific Accreditors:** (e.g., ABET for engineering, AACSB for business).

## Competition vs. CHEA / Dept of Ed Databases

| Feature | OCR-to-Hash | CHEA / DAPIP Database | Scanned PDF |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Integrity** | **Binds the Certificate.** Proves the *paper* is real. | **Data-Only.** Doesn't protect against forged certificates. | **Zero.** Easily forged. |
| **Speed** | **Instant.** Scan the paper on the wall. | **Slow.** Requires searching by school name and state. | **Instant.** |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Bound to the Accreditor. | **Gov-Bound.** Bound to the US Gov. | **Visual.** |
| **Alerting** | **Active.** Can show "PROBATION" in red. | **Passive.** Requires reading deep reports. | **Hidden.** |

**Why OCR wins here:** The "Lobby Entrance" reality. Parents and students decide to trust a school while standing in the lobby. They aren't going to search the federal DAPIP database on their phones. OCR-to-hash turns the **Institutional Trophy** into a **Digital Truth**, ensuring that the prestige of the certificate matches the reality of its accreditation.
