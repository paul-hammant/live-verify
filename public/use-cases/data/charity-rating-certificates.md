## What is a Charity Rating?

A **Charity Rating** is a "Grade" for a non-profit organization. Watchdog groups (like Charity Navigator) look at a charity's taxes to see if they are actually spending money on the mission or just on big salaries and marketing.

A **4-Star Rating** is the "Gold Standard" that charities display in their lobbies and on their websites to win over big donors.

Because a higher rating leads directly to more donations, some charities "Inflate" their stars on their marketing materials or hide that their rating was recently revoked. OCR-to-hash turns the wall certificate into a real-time link to the watchdog's database.

## Data Verified

Non-profit legal name, EIN, rating score (e.g., 4-stars), numerical efficiency percentage, governance pass/fail, reporting compliance, issue date, expiration date.

**Document Types:**
- **Accreditation Certificate:** The "Diploma" for the wall.
- **Rating Summary:** 1-page impact report for major donors.
- **Seal of Transparency:** For digital use (with OCR back-link).

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`charitynavigator.org`, `givewell.org`, `guidestar.org`) and current rating status.

**Status Indications:**
- **Current** — Rating is active and based on latest tax filings.
- **Under Review** — Rating paused due to major controversy or leadership shift.
- **Expired** — New financial data required for update.
- **Revoked** — Rating removed due to fraudulent reporting.

## Second-Party Use

The **Non-Profit Organization** benefits from verification.

**Major Giving:** Proving to a high-net-worth donor or a family foundation that their "4-Star" claim is verified by the source. This overcomes the "Skepticism Gap" in large-scale philanthropy.

**Corporate Matching:** Proving to a corporate matching partner (e.g., Microsoft or Google) that the charity meets the minimum required rating threshold for employee donations.

**Fundraising Appeals:** Including the verification link in year-end mailers to show donors that the "92% Efficiency" claim is a cryptographically verified fact.

## Third-Party Use

**Philanthropists / Donors**
**Due Diligence:** Before writing a $10,000 check, a donor scans the certificate displayed in the lobby. "Verified by Charity Navigator" provides instant confidence that the numbers aren't "self-reported fiction."

**Family Foundations**
**Grant Vetting:** Program officers can instantly verify the ratings of dozens of grant applicants by scanning their PDF summaries, bypassing manual database lookups.

**Media / Press**
**Fact Checking:** Verifying the "Top-Rated" claims made by charities in press releases or television interviews.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Rating Inflation" Fraud Problem**

- **Fake Stars:** A 2-star charity using Photoshop to change their certificate to show 4 stars.
- **Date Stretching:** Hiding a recent rating drop by changing the "Valid Until" date on an old certificate.
- **Name Spoofing:** A fraudulent "The American Cancer Fund" creating a fake certificate that looks like it belongs to the legitimate "American Cancer Society."

**Issuer Types**

**Watchdogs:** (Charity Navigator, BBB Wise Giving Alliance).
**Impact Evaluators:** (GiveWell, ImpactMatters).
**Data Aggregators:** (Candid / GuideStar).

## Competition vs. Guidestar Search

| Feature | OCR-to-Hash | GuideStar / Candid Search | Scanned JPEG Badge |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Bound to the Rater. | **Database.** High trust but requires manual navigation. | **Zero.** Easily copied. |
| **Integrity** | **Binds Numbers.** Protects the % Efficiency. | **Live.** Shows latest data. | **Vulnerable.** |
| **User Experience** | **Instant.** Scan the paper/PDF. | **Slow.** Requires typing EIN and finding the record. | **N/A.** |
| **B2B Integration** | **High.** Can be automated into grant software. | **Medium.** Requires expensive API access. | **Low.** |

**Why OCR wins here:** The "Front Lobby" moment. Charities display their ratings prominently to build trust. OCR-to-hash turns that **Visual Trophy** into a **Digital Truth**, ensuring that the trust a donor feels when seeing the certificate is backed by cryptographic reality.
