## Data Verified

Policyholder name, vehicle registration number (Plate), make/model, vehicle category, policy effective/expiration dates, country of issuance, covered countries (Green Card Bureau members), issuing carrier (NAIC/Company Code), PASSID reference.

**Document Types:**
- **International Motor Insurance Card:** (The "Green Card").
- **Frontier Insurance:** Temporary coverage for non-standard borders.
- **UK/EU Bail Bond:** (Linked hash) for legal protection after an accident.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`allianz.co.uk`, `axa.fr`) and current policy standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Active** — Premium paid; 3rd party liability is verified active.
- **Cancelled** — **ALERT:** Policy terminated; driver has no legal cross-border cover.
- **Expired** — The specific trip window has ended.
- **Restricted** — Valid only for specific countries (e.g., Turkey or Russia excluded).

## Second-Party Use

The **Driver (Traveler)** benefits from verification.

**Border Crossing:** Proving to a customs officer at a high-security border (e.g., UK to France, or entering Turkey) that the "Green Card" isn't a fake document created to bypass insurance requirements. A verified hash from the insurer's domain prevents the car from being seized at the border.

**Accident Protection:** If a driver has an accident in a foreign country, they can show the "Verified Active" status to the local police. This prevents them from being arrested for "Driving without Insurance" due to a translation error or clerical mistake.

## Third-Party Use

**Customs / Border Police (Frontex)**
**Enforcement:** Border agents can scan the hash while the car is in the queue. "Verified by Allianz" ensures the driver hasn't "Edited" the dates on a 15-day card to cover a 30-day trip.

**Foreign Police (Roadside)**
**Liability Verification:** Instantly confirming the 3rd party liability status after an international fender-bender, ensuring that the local victim's damages will be covered by the foreign insurer.

**Car Rental Agencies**
**Cross-Border Authorization:** Verifying that a customer's personal insurance actually covers the vehicle for the "Green Card" zone before allowing them to drive into a neighboring country.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Paper Road" Fraud Problem**

- **Date Tampering:** Scammers buying a cheap 1-week policy and editing the PDF to read "1 Year" to avoid paying hundreds in premiums.
- **Ghost Bureaus:** Creating fake "Council of Bureaux" certificates for high-risk drivers who have been blacklisted by legitimate carriers.
- **Country Swapping:** Editing a "Limited" card to include high-risk zones like Morocco or Albania that the actual policy excludes.

**Issuer Types**

**National Motor Insurers Bureaux:** (e.g., MIB in the UK).
**Global Insurance Carriers:** (Allianz, AXA, Generali).
**Frontier Insurance Vendors.**

## Competition vs. Central Databases (MID)

| Feature | OCR-to-Hash | MID / National DB (UK) | Paper Green Card |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Cross-Border** | **Universal.** Works via URL across all countries. | **Siloed.** French police can't easily check UK MID. | **Universal.** The global standard. |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Bound to the Carrier. | **Gov-Bound.** | **Visual.** Trusted via stamp. |
| **Speed** | **Instant.** 5-second scan at the checkpoint. | **Slow.** Requires specialized terminal access. | **Instant.** |
| **Freshness** | **Real-time.** Shows if premium was paid today. | **Laggy.** Often 24-48 hours behind. | **Static.** |

**Why OCR wins here:** The "Checkpoint" reality. A border officer in a booth has about 30 seconds per car. They cannot navigate 20 different national insurance databases in 20 different languages. OCR-to-hash turns the **Existing Global Paper Standard** into a live, high-speed digital dashboard that works across every border, app-free.
