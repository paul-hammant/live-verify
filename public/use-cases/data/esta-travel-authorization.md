## What is an ESTA?

If you are a citizen of a "Visa Waiver" country (like the UK, Japan, or France), you don't need a formal visa to visit the US for vacation. Instead, you need an **ESTA (Electronic System for Travel Authorization)**.

This is a digital permit that links your passport to the US border system. You apply online, and if approved, you print out a **Confirmation Notice**.

Airlines are fined thousands of dollars for every passenger they let onto a plane without a valid ESTA. If your paper is fake or altered, you will be stopped at the airport. Verified hashes allow the airline to see the "Approved" status on the government's domain in seconds.

## Data Verified

Application number, full name, date of birth, passport number, country of citizenship, authorization status (Approved/Pending), issuance date, expiration date.

**Document Types:**
- **ESTA Approval Printout:** The standard PDF for travelers.
- **Group Application Summary:** For families traveling together.
- **Status Change Notice:** Proving an old authorization was cancelled.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`cbp.dhs.gov`) and current travel standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Approved** — Traveler is authorized to board a carrier to the U.S.
- **Cancelled** — Authorization retracted (e.g., due to visa ineligibility).
- **Expired** — The 2-year validity period has ended.
- **Pending** — Under manual review (usually resolved in 72 hours).

## Second-Party Use

The **Traveler (Citizen of VWP Country)** benefits from verification.

**Airline Boarding:** Proving to an airline check-in agent in London or Tokyo that the paper printout isn't a "Fake Approval." Airlines are fined heavily for boarding passengers without valid ESTAs; a verified hash prevents the "Denied Boarding" nightmare caused by system lag or clerical errors.

**Hotel Check-In:** Proving legal entry status to a foreign hotel or car rental agency that requires proof of authorized stay.

## Third-Party Use

**Airlines (International Carriers)**
**Liability Mitigation:** Instantly confirming the ESTA status of a passenger during check-in. OCR-to-hash connects the airline directly to the CBP record, bypassing the need for manual data entry into the APIS system.

**Embassies / Consulates**
**Secondary Vetting:** Verifying the prior travel history of a visa applicant who previously traveled under the Visa Waiver Program (ESTA).

**Private Security / Event Organizers**
**Guest Vetting:** Ensuring that international VIP guests have verified, legal entry status for high-security events.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Fake Approval" Fraud Problem**

- **Fabricated PDFs:** Scammers creating fake "ESTA Approved" letters for people who are ineligible (e.g., due to a criminal record or travel to a restricted country).
- **Date Alteration:** Editing the "Expiration Date" on a 2024 approval to make it look like it's valid for a 2026 trip.
- **Passport Swapping:** Editing the name or passport number on a valid approval to match a different person.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP):** The sole issuer.
**DHS SAVE System:** (The backend cross-reference).

**Privacy Salt:** Critical. Passport numbers and names are highly sensitive. The hash must be salted to prevent "Guess-and-Check" attacks to find specific travelers.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing

A jurisdiction may require the issuer to retain a **witnessing firm** for regulatory compliance. The witnessing firm:

- Receives all hashes from the issuer, and any subsequent changes to the payload as they happen—which may manifest as a new hash, a status change, or even a 404 (record deleted)
- Receives structured content/metadata (key identifiers and dates)
- Does **NOT** receive plaintext or sensitive personal information
- Provides an immutable, timestamped audit trail—available to the jurisdiction on demand, to document holders/third parties during disputes, or as expert witness testimony in legal proceedings

This provides:
- **Non-repudiation:** Issuer cannot deny issuing the document
- **Timestamp proof:** Document existed at a specific time
- **Regulatory audit:** Jurisdictions can inspect the witness ledger for fraud detection
- **Resilience:** Verification works even if issuer's systems go down

**Public Blockchain (Non-Party)**

Witnessing firms may periodically commit rollups to an inexpensive public blockchain, providing an ultimate immutability guarantee. The blockchain is a "non-party"—infrastructure, not a participant in the transaction. This creates multiple verification paths:

1. **Issuer domain** — Direct check against the issuer
2. **Witnessing firm** — Independent confirmation with timestamp
3. **Public blockchain** — Decentralized trust anchor via rollup inclusion


## Competition vs. CBP Online Status Check

| Feature | OCR-to-Hash | ESTA Official Website | Scanned PDF / Printout |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Integrity** | **Binds Identity.** Binds Passport to Status. | **High.** Direct DB access. | **Zero.** Easily forged. |
| **Speed** | **Instant.** 5-second scan at check-in. | **Slow.** Requires typing Application # or Passport # + DOB. | **Instant.** |
| **Trust** | **Cryptographic.** Bound to `cbp.dhs.gov`. | **High.** But prone to phishing sites. | **Low.** Easily faked. |
| **Hardware** | **Universal.** Any smartphone camera. | **Technical.** Requires laptop/stable 5G. | **Visual.** |

**Why OCR wins here:** The "Airport Counter" reality. Check-in agents are under extreme time pressure. They don't have time to type 10-digit application numbers and 9-digit passport numbers into a website for every passenger. OCR-to-hash turns the **Physical Printout** into a live, high-speed digital key, ensuring safety and efficiency in global travel.
