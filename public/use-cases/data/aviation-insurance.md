## What is Aviation Insurance?

Insuring a jet is not like insuring a car. A single Gulfstream can be worth $75 million, and if it crashes into a building, the liability can be billions.

The **Certificate of Insurance (COI)** is the high-stakes document that pilots must show to airport towers and customs agents around the world.

If a pilot presents a fake certificate to land in London or Dubai, they are flying "uninsured" for hundreds of millions of dollars. Because there is no global database of plane insurance, officials rely on these printed papers. OCR-to-Hash provides the digital bridge they need.

## Data Verified

Insured name, aircraft registration (N-number), hull value, liability limits (CSL), policy effective/expiration dates, war risk inclusion, primary/excess carrier identification.

**Document Types:**
- **Certificate of Insurance (COI):** The standard "Proof of Insurance" for airports.
- **Aircraft Hull & Liability Policy:** The full multi-page contract.
- **War Risk Endorsement:** Critical for international flight into restricted zones.
- **Hangar Keepers Liability:** For FBOs and maintenance shops.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (the Underwriter) and current policy status.

**Status Indications:**
- **In Force** — Premium paid; policy active.
- **Cancelled** — Policy terminated (often due to non-payment or safety violations).
- **Expired** — Term ended; no coverage.
- **Grounded** — Underwriter has restricted flight (e.g., due to maintenance lapse).

## Second-Party Use

The **Aircraft Owner/Operator** (second party) receives the certificate of insurance from the underwriter (first party), **keeps it**, and may later hand it to third parties for various reasons, or never do so.

**Personal Record:** The owner has their own verified copy of insurance coverage. Most of the time, the document sits in the aircraft's documentation package—the verification value is latent, there *if needed*.

**Peace of Mind:** The owner can confirm at any time that the certificate matches what the underwriter's system recorded and hasn't been altered since they received it.

**Future Optionality:** If landing rights are needed at a foreign airport, an FBO requires proof of coverage, or a charter customer questions insurance adequacy, the owner has cryptographic proof ready without needing to contact the underwriter.

## Third-Party Use

The aircraft owner/operator (second party) may hand the verified document to various third parties:

**Airport Authorities (CAA / DGAC)**
Civil aviation inspectors can instantly verify the "War Risk" and "Liability" status of a foreign aircraft by scanning the COI, preventing unsafe or under-insured flight.

**Lienholders (Banks)**
Private jet lenders (e.g., Credit Suisse, Citi) verify that the $75M hull value is accurately insured and that the bank is listed as "Loss Payee."

**Charter Brokers**
Brokers like NetJets or Wheels Up can automatically verify the insurance status of "off-fleet" aircraft before booking them for a client.

## Verification Architecture

**The "High-Stakes" Fraud Problem**

- **Liability Padding:** Editing a $10M liability policy to look like a $100M policy to meet international landing requirements.
- **Cancellation Concealment:** Keeping a printed certificate after the policy was cancelled for non-payment (common in the small-aircraft/single-pilot world).
- **Hull Inflation:** Claiming a $5M hull value for a $1M aircraft to profit from an intentional crash (insurance fraud).

**Issuer Types (First Party)**

- Aviation Underwriters (Global Aerospace, Allianz, AXA XL, Starr)
- Specialist Brokers (Marsh, Aon, JLT)

**Privacy Salt:** Required. Aviation insurance certificates contain enumerable values—round dollar hull values ($75M, $100M), standard liability limits ($500M, $1B), common policy periods (annual), and publicly registered aircraft tail numbers. A competitor could feasibly enumerate combinations to reverse-engineer an operator's fleet insurance portfolio and undercut their renewal pricing. Salt protects these competitive insurance positions.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing

A jurisdiction may require aviation underwriters to retain a **witnessing firm** for regulatory compliance. The witnessing firm:

- Receives all hashes from the underwriter, and any subsequent changes to the payload as they happen—which may manifest as a new hash, a status change (cancelled, grounded), or even a 404 (record deleted)
- Receives structured content/metadata (aircraft registrations, policy numbers, coverage limits, effective dates)
- Does **NOT** receive plaintext (owner names, pilot details, specific route information)
- Provides an immutable, timestamped audit trail—available to the jurisdiction on demand, to operators/third parties during disputes, or as expert witness testimony in legal proceedings

This provides:
- **Non-repudiation:** Underwriter cannot deny issuing the certificate
- **Timestamp proof:** Coverage existed at a specific time (critical for incident claims)
- **Regulatory audit:** Civil aviation authorities can inspect the witness ledger for uninsured operations
- **Resilience:** Verification works even if underwriter's systems go down

**Public Blockchain (Non-Party)**

Witnessing firms may periodically commit rollups to an inexpensive public blockchain, providing an ultimate immutability guarantee. The blockchain is a "non-party"—infrastructure, not a participant in the transaction. This creates multiple verification paths:

1. **Underwriter domain** — Direct check against the issuer
2. **Witnessing firm** — Independent confirmation with timestamp
3. **Public blockchain** — Decentralized trust anchor via rollup inclusion

## Competition vs. FAA Registries

| Feature | OCR-to-Hash | FAA Civil Aviation Registry | Paper COI |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Granularity** | **High.** Shows insurance limits and dates. | **Zero.** FAA registry shows ownership but *not* insurance. | **High.** But untrusted. |
| **Cross-Border** | **Universal.** Works for any N-number or G-registration. | **Siloed.** National registries don't talk. | **Manual.** |
| **Freshness** | **Real-time.** Checks if the premium was paid today. | **Laggy.** Changes take weeks to update. | **Static.** |

**Why OCR wins here:** Aviation is a highly fragmented global industry. There is **no global database** of aircraft insurance. Every country requires proof of insurance, but they all rely on the "Persistent Paper" Certificate of Insurance. OCR-to-hash turns that global paper standard into a cryptographically trusted digital bridge.
