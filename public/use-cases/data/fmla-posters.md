## Data Verified

Poster version ID (e.g., 2026-V1), issuing authority (DOL Wage & Hour), mandatory entitlement text (12 weeks), eligibility criteria (1,250 hours/year), employer name (if custom), effective date of latest federal amendment.

**Document Types:**
- **FMLA Employee Rights Poster:** Mandatory breakroom display.
- **Notice of Eligibility (WH-381):** Issued to an individual employee.
- **Designation Notice (WH-382):** Formally approving/denying leave.
- **Medical Certification:** (Linked hash) proving health condition.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`dol.gov`) and current regulation status.

**Status Indications:**
- **Current** — Poster contains the latest mandatory federal rights text.
- **Outdated** — **ALERT:** The law has been amended; employer must replace the poster.
- **Informational** — Specific to military family leave or other sub-types.
- **Invalid** — Unofficial text detected.

## Second-Party Use

The **Employer (HR Director)** benefits from verification.

**Compliance Audit Defense:** Proving to a DOL investigator that the company is meeting its "Notice Obligations" under 29 CFR § 825.300. A verified hash on the breakroom poster prevents the $110+ per-day fine for failure to post current rights.

**Remote Worker Compliance:** Providing a verified link to the FMLA poster in the corporate "Hand-Book" app, ensuring that remote workers have access to the same verified info as on-site staff.

## Third-Party Use

**Employees**
**Rights Verification:** A worker who is being told "You only get 2 weeks" can scan the breakroom poster. "Verified by dol.gov" provides them with the legal proof that they are actually entitled to 12 weeks, empowering them to challenge bad-faith management.

**Department of Labor (WHD) Inspectors**
**Rapid Inspection:** An inspector can walk through a call center and scan every mandatory poster in 60 seconds. "Verified by dol.gov" proves the company isn't using "Legacy Paper" to hide new employee benefits.

**Employment Lawyers**
**Evidence:** In a "Wrongful Termination" lawsuit, verifying exactly what was posted on the company's bulletin board at the time of the dispute.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Rights Hiding" Fraud Problem**

- **Entitlement Editing:** A manager editing the PDF to change "12 weeks" to "4 weeks" to discourage employees from taking extended leave.
- **Old Versioning:** Keeping a 2010 version of the poster up to hide new protections for same-sex spouses or military caregivers.
- **Fake Notices:** Creating fake "Designation Notices" to trick employees into thinking their FMLA leave was denied by the government.

**Issuer Types**

**U.S. Department of Labor (WHD):** (The primary authority).
**Third-Party HR Platforms:** (e.g., Zenefits, Gusto - hosting the hashes).
**Labor Law Compliance Firms.**

## Competition vs. Subscription Poster Services

| Feature | OCR-to-Hash | Annual Subscription Service | Federal Government Website |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Integrity** | **Cryptographic.** Protects every sentence. | **Brand-Bound.** Trust the vendor logo. | **High.** But manual. |
| **Freshness** | **Real-time.** Shows if outdated today. | **Laggy.** Depends on mail cycles. | **Live.** |
| **Cost** | **Free.** (Marginal hosting). | **High.** $100-$300/year per site. | **Free.** |
| **User Access** | **High.** Instant scan for workers. | **None.** For employees. | **Slow.** Requires manual search. |

**Why OCR wins here:** The "Legal Shield." Labor laws change suddenly. A subscription service might take 3 weeks to mail a new poster. OCR-to-hash tells the employer **today** that their poster is outdated, allowing them to print a new one instantly and avoid a $110/day fine that could have accrued during the mail delay.
