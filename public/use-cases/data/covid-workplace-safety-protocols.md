## What is a Safety Protocol Poster?

When a health crisis occurs, employers must post **Workplace Safety Protocols** in every breakroom. These posters tell employees and visitors the rules for "Masking," "Social Distancing," and "Vaccination."

These rules change constantly as new variants or laws emerge.

Fraud ("Safety Theater") happens when a local manager leaves an outdated poster up to hide that they are violating current corporate or government safety standards. OCR-to-hash turns the paper on the wall into a live link to the latest, verified safety policy from Headquarters.

## Data Verified

Employer name, facility location, specific protocol version, vaccination requirement status, testing frequency, mask mandate level, ventilation standards, date of policy adoption, safety officer name.

**Document Types:**
- **Workplace Safety Poster:** Mandatory display in breakrooms.
- **Vaccination Policy Extract:** For employee handbooks.
- **Testing Compliance Certificate:** For site-specific audits.
- **Return-to-Work Authorization:** For individual employees post-infection.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (the Employer or Health Dept) and current policy standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Active** — Policy is the latest approved version.
- **Updated** — A newer safety protocol has been issued (e.g., due to a new variant).
- **Suspended** — Facility closed or protocols under emergency revision.
- **Under Review** — Audit pending by OSHA or Health Dept.

## Second-Party Use

The **Employee** benefits from verification.

**Rights Protection:** Proving that the safety rules the manager is demanding (e.g., "Must wear N95") are actually the verified corporate policy and not an arbitrary rule.

**Workplace Confidence:** Scanning the breakroom poster to see "Verified by Corporate HQ" ensures that the local site manager isn't "Watering Down" the safety standards to save money on PPE.

## Third-Party Use

**OSHA / Health Inspectors**
**Audit Efficiency:** During a surprise inspection, the officer can scan the posted notice. "Verified by Acme Global" ensures the poster isn't a "Fake Compliance" prop created just for the inspection.

**Facility Visitors / Clients**
**Safety Vetting:** Before entering a large office tower or factory, a visitor can scan the verified protocol to understand the level of risk and the requirements they must follow.

**Insurance Carriers (Workers Comp)**
**Liability Audit:** Verifying that the insured company is actually maintaining the safety protocols they claimed in their underwriting application, which directly impacts their premium rates.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Safety Theater" Fraud Problem**

- **Fabricated Policies:** Creating a realistic-looking "OSHA Compliant" poster while actually ignoring all safety guidelines on the floor.
- **Outdated Postings:** Leaving a 2022 "Mask Optional" poster up during a 2026 outbreak when the corporate policy has switched back to "Mandatory."
- **Ghost Compliance:** Claiming a facility has "Verified 100% Vaccination" when the HR records aren't actually linked to the verification hash.

**Issuer Types**

**Corporations:** (Hosting on their own `/safety` or `/hr` domain).
**Government Agencies:** (e.g., OSHA, CDC - providing model hashes).
**Health Platforms:** (e.g., Clear, VitalCheck).

**Privacy Salt:** Critical. Any individual "Vaccination Proof" documents must be salted to protect employee medical privacy.

## Competition vs. Static PDF Posters

| Feature | OCR-to-Hash | Static PDF / Printout | Employee Portal |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Bound to the Employer. | **Zero.** Just a piece of paper. | **System-Bound.** |
| **Integrity** | **Binds Details.** Protects the PPE rules. | **Vulnerable.** Easily edited. | **High.** |
| **Freshness** | **Real-time.** Shows if updated today. | **None.** Relies on someone swapping paper. | **Live.** |
| **User Access** | **Universal.** Any employee/visitor. | **Universal.** | **Restricted.** Requires login. |

**Why OCR wins here:** The "Breakroom Reality." Most safety info is delivered via paper on a bulletin board. OCR-to-hash turns that **Bulletin Board** into a live, trusted data-point, ensuring that the info employees rely on for their physical safety is the latest, non-altered truth from the company.
