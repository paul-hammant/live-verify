## What is a Guarantor Release?

A guarantor release confirms that someone who personally guaranteed a debt, lease, or other obligation has been released from that guarantee. The primary obligor remains responsible, but the guarantor's personal liability is extinguished.

Guarantor releases are critical for credit and financial planning. While guaranteed, the full debt appears as a contingent liability. A fraudulent release could mislead lenders about a guarantor's true exposure.

## Data Verified

Creditor/landlord name, loan/lease identifier, primary obligor name, guarantor name, original guarantee amount or terms, release date, release reason, any continuing obligations.

**Document Types:**
- **Student Loan Co-Signer Release:** After qualifying payments, co-signer released.
- **Commercial Lease Guarantee Release:** Personal guarantee for business lease lifted.
- **SBA Loan Guarantee Release:** Personal guarantee released after loan payoff.
- **Apartment Co-Signer Release:** Parent or other co-signer released after tenant qualifies independently.
- **Equipment Lease Guarantee Release:** Personal guarantee for equipment financing removed.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`salliemae.com`, `sba.gov`) and guarantee status.

**Status Indications:**
- **Released** — Guarantor fully released from all obligations.
- **Partial Release** — Released from some but not all guaranteed obligations.
- **Conditional** — Release subject to conditions (e.g., no default within 90 days).
- **Reinstated** — Release rescinded due to subsequent default.
- **Superseded** — New guarantee agreement replaces old one.

## Second-Party Use

The **Guarantor** benefits from verification.

**Credit Applications:** Personal guarantees appear as contingent liabilities on credit reports. A verified release letter proves the guarantor is no longer liable, improving debt-to-income ratios.

**Mortgage Qualification:** When guarantors apply for mortgages, lenders count guaranteed debts against them. Verified releases remove these from consideration.

**Estate Planning:** Guarantors need documentation that obligations won't pass to their estate. Verified releases provide this assurance.

**Business Transitions:** When founders leave companies, they need verified proof that personal guarantees for business debts are released.

## Third-Party Use

**Mortgage Lenders**
**Underwriting:** Lenders underwriting the guarantor for their own loans need to verify which guarantees remain active and which are released.

**Credit Bureaus**
**Reporting Accuracy:** Verified releases help ensure credit reports accurately reflect released guarantees rather than showing them as open contingent liabilities.

**Business Buyers**
**Due Diligence:** When acquiring a business, buyers verify that sellers' personal guarantees on business debts are properly released at closing.

**Divorce Attorneys**
**Asset Division:** In divorce proceedings, verified guarantee releases prove which spouse remains liable for jointly-guaranteed debts.

**Insurance Underwriters**
**D&O Coverage:** Directors and Officers insurance underwriters assess personal guarantee exposure. Verified releases reduce this exposure.

## Verification Architecture

**The Guarantor Release Fraud Problem**

- **Fake Releases:** Fraudulent release letters used to qualify for new loans while guarantees remain active.
- **Premature Claims:** Claiming release before qualifying conditions are met.
- **Scope Inflation:** Fake releases claiming broader release than actually granted.
- **Identity Confusion:** Releases for the wrong guarantor on multi-guarantor obligations.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**Student Loan Servicers:** (Sallie Mae, Nelnet, Great Lakes) co-signer release programs.
**Commercial Landlords:** (Brookfield, CBRE, Greystar) personal guarantee releases.
**Banks:** Business loan and line of credit guarantee releases.
**SBA:** Government-backed loan guarantee releases.
**Equipment Lessors:** (De Lage Landen, CIT) equipment lease guarantee releases.

**Credit Reporting Integration**

Lenders issuing guarantee releases could submit verification hashes to credit bureaus, enabling guarantors to prove release status when disputing credit report entries.

**Multi-Guarantor Complexity**

When multiple guarantors exist (e.g., several partners guaranteeing a business loan), releases may be individual. Each guarantor needs their own verified release; one partner's release doesn't affect others.


## Jurisdictional Witnessing

A jurisdiction may require the issuer to retain a **witnessing firm** for regulatory compliance. The witnessing firm:

- Receives all hashes from the issuer, and any subsequent changes to the payload as they happen—which may manifest as a new hash, a status change, or even a 404 (record deleted)
- Receives structured content/metadata (key identifiers and dates)
- Does **NOT** receive plaintext or sensitive personal information
- Provides an immutable, timestamped audit trail—available to the jurisdiction on demand, to document holders/third parties during disputes, or as expert witness testimony in legal proceedings

This provides:
- **Non-repudiation:** Issuer cannot deny issuing the document
- **Timestamp proof:** Document existed at a specific time
- **Regulatory audit:** Jurisdictions can inspect the witness ledger for fraud detection
- **Resilience:** Verification works even if issuer's systems go down

**Public Blockchain (Non-Party)**

Witnessing firms may periodically commit rollups to an inexpensive public blockchain, providing an ultimate immutability guarantee. The blockchain is a "non-party"—infrastructure, not a participant in the transaction. This creates multiple verification paths:

1. **Issuer domain** — Direct check against the issuer
2. **Witnessing firm** — Independent confirmation with timestamp
3. **Public blockchain** — Decentralized trust anchor via rollup inclusion
