## What is Weather Insurance?

Outdoor festivals (like Coachella or Austin City Limits) are massive financial gambles. If it rains 2 inches in 4 hours, the equipment is ruined and the fans want their money back.

**Weather Insurance** (or "Pluvius") pays for these losses.

The policy is "Parametric"—meaning it pays out automatically if a specific weather station records more than a certain amount of rain. Verified hashes allow fans and sponsors to see the **un-altered rain triggers** on the insurer's domain, ensuring the promoter can't "hide" that the trigger was met to avoid paying refunds.

## Data Verified

Event name, exact location, coverage limit, specific weather triggers (e.g., rainfall depth, wind speed), monitoring station ID (e.g., NOAA station), time-window for triggers, event start/end dates, issuing carrier.

**Document Types:**
- **Evidence of Weather Insurance:** For venue owners and sponsors.
- **Pluvius Policy:** (Traditional name for rain insurance).
- **Adverse Weather Report:** (Linked hash) from the weather station.
- **Refund Authorization Notice:** For ticket holders.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`hiscox.com`, `beazley.com`) and policy standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **In Force** — Premium paid; event covered.
- **Triggered** — **ALERT:** Verified weather data has met the policy threshold.
- **Cancelled** — Policy terminated (often due to non-payment).
- **Lapsed** — Event passed without a trigger.

## Second-Party Use

The **Event Promoter** benefits from verification.

**Sponsor Confidence:** Proving to a $1M+ sponsor that their "Activation Cost" is fully insured against rain. If it pours, the sponsor gets their money back. A verified certificate from `hiscox.com` removes the sponsor's fear of "Paperwork Scams."

**Ticket Vendor Trust:** Proving to platforms like Ticketmaster or Eventbrite that there is a verified "Refund Pool" in place, allowing the platform to issue "Weather Guarantees" to ticket buyers.

## Third-Party Use

**Venue Owners (Parks / Stadiums)**
**Risk Transfer:** Ensuring that if the event is rained out, the promoter has the verified cash to pay the venue's cleanup and idle-staff costs.

**Ticket Holders (Fans)**
**Refund Transparency:** Fans can scan the verification hash on their ticket or the event website. If the status says "TRIGGERED," they have cryptographically solid proof that they are entitled to a refund based on the insurer's own record.

**Reinsurers**
**Exposure Tracking:** Verifying the digital hashes of all "Rain Policies" in a specific city to ensure they aren't over-concentrated in one geographic zone during a regional storm.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Fake Forecast" Fraud Problem**

- **Trigger Tampering:** Editing a PDF to change a "1.0 inch" rain trigger to "0.1 inch" to trick a sponsor into thinking they are more protected than they are.
- **Ghost Policies:** Claiming to have weather insurance to sell more tickets, but never actually paying the premium.
- **Station Fraud:** Fabricating a "Local Weather Report" from a non-existent station to claim a payout.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**Specialty Carriers:** (Hiscox, Beazley, Chubb, Sompo International).
**Weather Data Providers:** (NOAA, AccuWeather - hosting the trigger hashes).
**MGA Specialists.**

## Jurisdictional Witnessing

A jurisdiction may require the issuer to retain a **witnessing firm** for regulatory compliance. The witnessing firm:

- Receives all hashes from the issuer, and any subsequent changes to the payload as they happen—which may manifest as a new hash, a status change, or even a 404 (record deleted)
- Receives structured content/metadata (key identifiers and dates)
- Does **NOT** receive plaintext or sensitive personal information
- Provides an immutable, timestamped audit trail—available to the jurisdiction on demand, to document holders/third parties during disputes, or as expert witness testimony in legal proceedings

This provides:
- **Non-repudiation:** Issuer cannot deny issuing the document
- **Timestamp proof:** Document existed at a specific time
- **Regulatory audit:** Jurisdictions can inspect the witness ledger for fraud detection
- **Resilience:** Verification works even if issuer's systems go down

**Public Blockchain (Non-Party)**

Witnessing firms may periodically commit rollups to an inexpensive public blockchain, providing an ultimate immutability guarantee. The blockchain is a "non-party"—infrastructure, not a participant in the transaction. This creates multiple verification paths:

1. **Issuer domain** — Direct check against the issuer
2. **Witnessing firm** — Independent confirmation with timestamp
3. **Public blockchain** — Decentralized trust anchor via rollup inclusion


## Competition vs. Automated Payouts (Parametric)

| Feature | OCR-to-Hash | Parametric Insurance (API) | Scanned PDF |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **User Access** | **Universal.** Fans/Sponsors can verify. | **Zero.** The trigger happens in a private API loop between bank and insurer. | **Instant.** |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Bound to the Carrier. | **Algorithm-Bound.** | **Zero.** Easily forged. |
| **Integrity** | **Binds Content.** Protects the "Fine Print" triggers. | **Data-Only.** | **Vulnerable.** |
| **Speed** | **Instant.** 5-second scan. | **Fast.** Automated payout. | **N/A.** |

**Why OCR wins here:** The "Transparency" gap. Parametric insurance is the gold standard for speed, but it is a "Black Box" to the fans and sponsors. OCR-to-hash turns the **Paper Evidence of Insurance** into a live "Truth Portal," allowing everyone involved in the event to see the exact same verified data as the insurance company's computer.
