## What is a Yield Report?

Modern farm equipment (like a John Deere combine) is full of sensors that measure exactly how much grain is harvested from every inch of a field. This data is used to create a **Yield Report**.

This report is the "Bottom Line" for a farm. It is used to:
1.  **Calculate Rent:** In "Yield-Share" leases where the landlord gets a % of the crop.
2.  **Claim Insurance:** Proving how much crop was lost to a storm.
3.  **Get Loans:** Proving the farm is productive.

Fraud happens when a farmer "Edits" the report to show a lower yield (to pay less rent or get more insurance money). Verified hashes bind the **Static PDF Report** to the equipment's official cloud log, ensuring the numbers are the "Mechanical Truth."

## Data Verified

Producer name, field GPS boundaries, crop type, total weight/volume, average moisture content, calculated yield per acre (Bushels/Acre), equipment ID, operator ID, harvest timestamp, calibration status of sensors.

**Document Types:**
- **Yield Map / Summary:** Visual and numerical data from the combine.
- **Scale Ticket:** Official weight from the grain elevator.
- **Production Report:** Mandatory filing for federal crop insurance.
- **Traceability Certificate:** Proving origin for "Organic" or "Non-GMO" premiums.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`deere.com`, `climate.com`, `trimble.com`) and data status.

**Status Indications:**
- **Certified** — Data generated by calibrated telematics; matches the cloud log.
- **Estimated** — Manual data entry; sensors uncalibrated.
- **Audited** — Figures match the scale tickets from the elevator.
- **Disputed** — Conflict detected between multiple monitoring systems.

## Second-Party Use

The **Farmer (Producer)** benefits from verification.

**Crop Insurance Claims:** Proving to an insurance adjuster that the "150 BU/ACRE" yield loss isn't a fabricated number. A verified hash from the John Deere or Climate FieldView domain provides the adjuster with instant, trusted evidence, speeding up the $50,000+ claim payout.

**Landlord Rent:** In "Yield-Based" leases, providing verified proof of the harvest to the landowner to calculate the correct rent payment, preventing disputes over "Under-reporting."

## Third-Party Use

**Crop Insurance Companies (AIPs)**
**Claim Adjudication:** Instantly verifying the "Acreage and Production" (APH) history of a farm. OCR-to-hash ensures the farmer hasn't "Photoshopped" a better yield history to get a higher insurance guarantee.

**Grain Buyers (ADM / Cargill)**
**Supply Chain Traceability:** Verifying the "Field of Origin" for high-premium crops (e.g., identity-preserved non-GMO soy).

**Ag-Lenders (Banks)**
**Credit Scoring:** Verifying the historical productivity of a farm before approving a multi-million dollar mortgage or equipment loan.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Ghost Harvest" Fraud Problem**

- **Yield Inflation:** Editing a 180 BU/ACRE yield to 220 BU/ACRE to inflate the farm's value before a sale.
- **Production Under-reporting:** Changing a 200 BU/ACRE yield to 140 BU/ACRE to trigger a fraudulent crop insurance payout.
- **Calibration Fraud:** Claiming sensors were calibrated when they weren't, leading to inaccurate (usually inflated) numbers.

**Issuer Types**

**OEM Telematics Platforms:** (John Deere, Case IH, Fendt).
**Ag-Tech Platforms:** (Climate FieldView, Trimble, Granular).
**Grain Elevators:** (Issuing the "Final Truth" scale tickets).

## Competition vs. Ag-Tech APIs

| Feature | OCR-to-Hash | Ag-Tech API (FieldView) | Paper Scale Ticket |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Bound to the OEM. | **System-Bound.** | **Zero.** Easily forged. |
| **User Privacy** | **High.** Share only the *Yield Summary*. | **Low.** API access often reveals *full* farm maps. | **High.** |
| **Interoperability** | **Universal.** Works across all combine brands. | **Low.** Hard to link a JD combine to a Case IH app. | **Universal.** |
| **Speed** | **Instant.** 5-second scan. | **Slow.** Requires account linking and permissions. | **N/A.** |

**Why OCR wins here:** The "Field Handoff." Insurance adjusters and bank officers meet farmers in trucks or barns. They work with PDFs and paper printouts. They don't have the technical expertise or time to "Link API Accounts" across 5 different ag-tech platforms. OCR-to-hash turns the **Static Yield Report** into a live, trusted clinical link.
