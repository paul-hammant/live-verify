## What is an Asset Unfreeze Notice?

An asset unfreeze notice confirms that a previously frozen or held account, asset, or fund has been released and is now accessible. Freezes occur for various reasons: court orders, regulatory holds, sanctions, fraud investigations, or bank compliance reviews.

The unfreeze notice is critical for proving access has been restored. Fraud includes fake releases to manipulate credit decisions or claim assets are available when they remain frozen.

## Data Verified

Institution name, account/asset identifier, account holder name, type of hold/freeze, original freeze date, release date, reason for release, any continuing restrictions.

**Document Types:**
- **Account Hold Release:** Bank compliance hold lifted.
- **Garnishment Release:** Court-ordered garnishment satisfied.
- **OFAC Specific License:** Sanctions blocking released.
- **Levy Release:** IRS or state tax levy satisfied.
- **Fraud Hold Release:** Investigation completed, funds released.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`wellsfargo.com`, `treasury.gov`) and current account status.

**Status Indications:**
- **Released** — All holds lifted, full access restored.
- **Partial Release** — Some funds released, hold continues on remainder.
- **Conditional Release** — Released subject to conditions.
- **Re-Frozen** — New hold placed after release.
- **Expired** — OFAC license or court order no longer valid.

## Second-Party Use

The **Account Holder** benefits from verification.

**Credit Applications:** Frozen accounts appear problematic on applications. A verified unfreeze notice proves the issue is resolved.

**Business Continuity:** Companies with frozen accounts need to prove to partners and vendors that they can now transact normally.

**Employment:** Some employers check financial history. A verified release explains past freezes without casting continuing doubt.

## Third-Party Use

**Banks / Financial Institutions**
**Account Opening:** When opening new accounts, banks check for prior freezes. A verified release confirms the issue is resolved.

**Lenders**
**Underwriting:** Mortgage and business loan underwriters need to understand asset availability. Verified unfreezes confirm funds are accessible.

**Compliance Officers**
**Due Diligence:** When onboarding clients with freeze history, compliance teams verify that sanctions or regulatory issues are resolved.

**Business Partners**
**Vendor Qualification:** Companies may require proof that prospective partners don't have frozen assets or sanctions issues.

## Verification Architecture

**The Asset Freeze Fraud Problem**

- **Fake Releases:** Fraudsters create fake unfreeze letters to claim access to frozen funds.
- **Premature Release Claims:** Claiming funds are available when freeze is ongoing.
- **Sanctions Evasion:** Fake OFAC licenses to facilitate prohibited transactions.
- **Identity Fraud:** Using someone else's release letter to open accounts.

**Issuer Types**

**Banks:** Internal compliance hold releases.
**Courts:** Garnishment and judgment satisfaction.
**Treasury/OFAC:** Sanctions license grants.
**IRS/State Tax:** Levy releases.
**Regulators:** (OCC, FDIC, SEC) enforcement action releases.

**Sanctions Compliance**

OFAC licenses are public record but verification is critical. Parties to transactions involving formerly-blocked persons need verified proof that a license exists and remains valid.

**Court Integration**

Courts could issue garnishment releases with verification hashes, allowing banks to confirm release authenticity before releasing funds.
