## What is Anonymous Group Participation?

Support groups, therapy circles, and survivor communities depend on anonymity for honest participation. But pure anonymity creates problems:
- No accountability if someone harasses other members
- Can't verify someone is who they claim (e.g., actually a survivor, not a voyeur)
- Predators can exploit anonymous access to vulnerable people
- No recourse if someone threatens or stalks members outside the group

Identity escrow provides **verified anonymity**—members are anonymous to each other but accountable through a trusted third party.

## Derivation 1: 12-Step Programs (AA/NA)

**The Problem:**
Alcoholics Anonymous famously protects anonymity: "What you hear here, stays here." But AA meetings are open to anyone. This openness has been exploited:
- Predators targeting vulnerable people in recovery
- Journalists infiltrating for stories
- Employers sending spies to check on employees
- Stalkers following targets to meetings

There's no verification that attendees are there in good faith, and no accountability if someone violates the group's trust.

Member ID: RC-MEM-REDACTED
Member Since: March 2023

MEETING NAME: Tuesday Night Serenity Group
MEETING TYPE: Alcoholics Anonymous (Open)
LOCATION: [Disclosed to verified members only]

MEMBER STATUS: Verified Participant
  - Identity verified with RecoveryCircle
  - Stated purpose: Personal recovery
  - No safety incidents on file

This member has agreed to:
  ✓ Maintain confidentiality of other members
  ✓ Not contact members outside group without consent
  ✓ Report any safety concerns to group facilitator

<span data-verify-line="aa">verify:recoverycircle.org/member/v</span> <span verifiable-text="end" data-for="aa">]</span></pre>
</div>

**What Gets Escrowed:**
- Real identity (verified via ID)
- Contact information
- Stated purpose for attending
- Safety incident history (if any, across groups)

**What Other Members See:**
- First name (or chosen alias)
- "Verified participant" badge
- Length of membership
- Nothing else

**Accountability Features:**
- **Incident reporting:** Members can report harassment, stalking, inappropriate contact
- **Pattern detection:** Same person reported by multiple members = escalation
- **Cross-group visibility:** Bad actor banned from one group is flagged for others
- **Facilitator alerts:** Group leaders see safety-relevant history

**Disclosure Triggers:**
- Police report (stalking, assault, threats)
- Multiple independent safety reports
- Facilitator safety determination
- NOT: simple disagreements or personality conflicts

**Preserving AA Traditions:**
- No attendance logging (privacy maintained)
- No sobriety verification (not the point)
- Open meetings remain open (but verified)
- Anonymity to other members preserved
- "Anonymity is the spiritual foundation" still honored—but predators aren't protected

## Derivation 2: Group Therapy

**The Problem:**
Therapy groups (grief, anger management, eating disorders, trauma) require vulnerability. Members share deeply personal information with strangers. The therapist is licensed and bound by ethics, but other group members aren't.

**How Identity Escrow Helps:**

<div style="max-width: 650px; margin: 24px auto; border: 1px solid #ccc; background: #fff; padding: 20px; box-shadow: 0 4px 10px rgba(0,0,0,0.05);">

Facilitator: Dr. Sarah Chen, LCSW (License #12345)
Session: Wednesdays, 7pm

MEMBER: Verified #M-REDACTED
  - Identity verified
  - Eligibility confirmed: Bereaved family member
  - Confidentiality agreement signed

MEMBER COMMITMENTS:
  ✓ Maintain confidentiality of group discussions
  ✓ No contact with members outside group without

<span data-verify-line="therapy">verify:therapygroups.org/member/v</span> <span verifiable-text="end" data-for="therapy">]</span></pre>
</div>

**Eligibility Verification:**
- Grief group: Verification of loss (death certificate reference, funeral program)
- Eating disorder: Clinician referral
- Trauma survivor: Self-attestation with facilitator conversation
- Anger management: Court order or self-referral

**Why Eligibility Matters:**
- Prevents voyeurs joining survivor groups
- Keeps support groups focused on shared experience
- Deters people with ulterior motives

**Therapist Integration:**
- Facilitator has identity access (for safety management)
- Can remove members with full identity record
- Can report to licensing board if necessary

## Derivation 3: Online Support Communities

**The Problem:**
Chronic illness forums, mental health subreddits, caregiver support groups—these communities provide vital peer support. But online anonymity enables:
- Fake patients seeking attention (Munchausen by internet)
- People harvesting stories for content/journalism
- Trolls attacking vulnerable people
- Predators building relationships with isolated individuals

**How Identity Escrow Helps:**

<div style="max-width: 650px; margin: 24px auto; border: 1px solid #ccc; background: #fff; padding: 20px; box-shadow: 0 4px 10px rgba(0,0,0,0.05);">
  <pre style="margin: 0; font-family: 'Courier New', monospace; font-size: 0.85em; white-space: pre; color: #000; line-height: 1.6;"><span verifiable-text="start" data-for="online">[</span>COMMUNITY MEMBER VERIFICATION

## Derivation 4: Survivor Support Groups

**The Problem:**
Domestic violence, sexual assault, and abuse survivor groups are high-stakes environments. Participants are often:
- Hiding from abusers
- Dealing with trauma responses
- Highly vulnerable to re-traumatization
- Potential targets for predators posing as survivors

Pure anonymity protects survivors but also protects abusers who infiltrate these spaces.

**How Identity Escrow Helps:**

<div style="max-width: 650px; margin: 24px auto; border: 1px solid #ccc; background: #fff; padding: 20px; box-shadow: 0 4px 10px rgba(0,0,0,0.05);">

Group: Phoenix Rising DV Support
Meeting Type: Closed (survivors only)

MEMBER: [First name only shown to group]
  - Identity verified with SafeSpace Network
  - Survivor status confirmed via intake process
  - No cross-group safety flags

SAFETY FEATURES:
  ✓ Address shielded (not on file)
  ✓ Contact via secure relay only
  ✓ Location of meetings protected

Emergency contact on file with SafeSpace only.

<span data-verify-line="surv">verify:safespace.org/member/v</span> <span verifiable-text="end" data-for="surv">]</span></pre>
</div>

**Special Privacy Protections:**
- **Address shielding:** Address not collected or stored
- **Name protection:** Can use chosen name throughout
- **Meeting location confidentiality:** Only verified members know location
- **Contact relay:** All contact goes through secure intermediary

**Survivor Verification (Sensitive):**
- Referral from DV shelter, hospital, or advocate
- Self-attestation with facilitator conversation
- NOT police reports (many survivors don't report)
- Emphasis on believing survivors while screening for red flags

**Red Flag Screening:**
- Abuser trying to find victim
- Fetishist seeking trauma stories
- Journalist seeking sources without consent
- Anyone asking unusual questions about other members

**Cross-Group Safety Network:**
- Person removed from one survivor group is flagged network-wide
- Protects against "group shopping" by predators
- Privacy preserved: flag is visible, reason is not (unless safety-critical)

## Verification Architecture

**The Anonymity-Accountability Spectrum:**

```
Fully Anonymous        Escrowed Identity        Fully Identified
      │                       │                       │
      ▼                       ▼                       ▼
Anyone can join        Verified but private    Names visible
No recourse            Accountable via escrow  Maximum accountability
Predators protected    Predators deterred      Participation chilled
Open to abuse          Abuse has consequences  Too exposed for safety
```

**Why Full Anonymity Fails:**
- No consequences for bad behavior
- No way to ban someone effectively (new account, back they come)
- Predators seek out anonymous spaces specifically
- Vulnerable people deserve protection, not just privacy

**Why Full Identification Fails:**
- Survivors may be hiding from abusers
- Stigma prevents participation (addiction, mental health)
- Employers, family may discover membership
- Chills honest sharing

**Escrowed Identity is the Middle Path:**
- Anonymous to other members
- Accountable through trusted third party
- Verification possible without exposure
- Bad actors can be identified and banned

**Trust Architecture:**

Who holds the escrow matters:
- **12-step programs:** Independent nonprofit (not AA itself, which has no central authority)
- **Therapy groups:** Healthcare-adjacent entity with HIPAA awareness
- **Online communities:** Platform-independent verification service
- **Survivor groups:** Trauma-informed organization with advocacy expertise

## Post-Verification Actions

**For Facilitators/Moderators:**

After verification, the escrow service can provide:
- Confirmation that member is verified (no identity details)
- Safety flags if any exist
- Secure channel to report incidents

**For Members:**

- Portable verification across groups
- Control over what information is shared
- Clear process if they need to report an incident
- Clear process if they are falsely accused

## Jurisdictional Considerations

**Mandatory Reporting:**
- Facilitators may be mandatory reporters (child abuse, elder abuse)
- Identity escrow doesn't shield from mandatory reporting obligations
- Escrow service must have clear policies on legal requests

**Healthcare Privacy:**
- Therapy groups may involve PHI
- HIPAA may apply to facilitator
- Escrow service should be HIPAA-aware if handling health-related verification

**Survivor Protections:**
- Address confidentiality programs in many states
- Violence Against Women Act protections
- Safe at Home type programs

**Public Blockchain (Non-Party)**

Witnessing firms may periodically commit hash rollups to a public blockchain, providing:
- Proof that safety reports existed at specific times
- Tamper-evidence if escrow provider is compromised
- Accountability if escrow provider fails to act on reports
