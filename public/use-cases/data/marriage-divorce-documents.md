## Data Verified

Spouse full names, dates of birth, marriage date, license number, certificate serial number, officiant name, location of ceremony, county of issuance, date of recording.

**Document Types:**
- **Marriage Certificate:** Official proof of union (post-ceremony).
- **Divorce Decree:** Final court order dissolving a marriage.
- **Domestic Partnership:** For non-marriage legal unions.
- **Annulment Order:** (Linked hash) proving the union was voided.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`clarkcountynv.gov`, `nycourts.gov`) and current status.

**Status Indications:**
- **Valid/Recorded** — Record exists and matches the official registry.
- **Dissolved** — **ALERT:** Marriage was subsequently ended by divorce or annulment.
- **Amended** — Original record corrected (e.g., due to name spelling error).
- **Void** — Assigned to wrong parties or found to be fraudulent.

## Second-Party Use

The **Named Spouse(s)** benefit from verification.

**Name Change:** Proving to the Social Security Administration (SSA) or a bank that the "Marriage Certificate" isn't a fake PDF created to commit identity fraud. Verification against the county domain allows for instant, automated name-change processing.

**Immigration / Green Card:** Proving a "Bona Fide Marriage" to USCIS. A verified certificate from the county is the ultimate defense against "Fake Marriage" accusations during a visa interview.

**Insurance Enrollment:** Proving marital status to an employer's HR department to add a spouse to a health insurance plan.

## Third-Party Use

**Government Agencies (SSA / USCIS)**
**Identity Integrity:** Instantly verifying the foundational civil status of an applicant. OCR-to-hash connects the agency directly to the county registrar, stopping "Paperwork Scams" where people use fake certificates to steal survivor benefits.

**Mortgage Lenders**
**Title Vetting:** Verifying marital status during a property purchase to ensure "Spousal Consent" or "Homestead Rights" are properly addressed in the deed.

**Attorneys / Probate Courts**
**Heir Verification:** Confirming the legal status of a surviving spouse before distributing multimillion-dollar estate assets.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Paper Bride" Fraud Problem**

- **Fabricated Certificates:** Using a template to create a fake "Marriage Certificate" for a non-existent union to get a Green Card or military benefits.
- **Bigamy Concealment:** Presenting a "Valid" marriage paper while hiding that a "Divorce Decree" has already been issued for that union. Verification shows the *latest* status (Dissolved).
- **Name Tampering:** Editing a PDF to change the name of one spouse to gain access to their bank accounts or inheritance.

**Issuer Types**

**County Clerks / Registrars:** (Primary issuers for marriage).
**Superior / Family Courts:** (Issuers for divorce decrees).
**State Departments of Health:** (Managing long-term vital records).

**Privacy Salt:** ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL. Marital status is highly private. The hash MUST be salted to prevent "Mass Scraping" of a county's marriage history by data brokers or stalkers.

## Competition vs. Certified Copies (Raised Seals)

| Feature | OCR-to-Hash | Certified Copy (Physical Seal) | Public Portal (Online Search) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Integrity** | **Cryptographic.** Protects every name/date. | **Binds Paper.** Doesn't prevent "Name Edits." | **Data-Only.** |
| **Speed** | **Instant.** 5-second scan. | **Manual.** Requires physical inspection. | **Slow.** Requires search & CAPTCHAs. |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Bound to the County. | **Signature-Bound.** | **Gov-Bound.** |
| **Cost** | **Low.** Standard web infra. | **High.** Fees of $20-$50 per copy are common. | **Medium.** Per-search fees. |

**Why OCR wins here:** Reach. Many counties do not have public-facing "Search Portals" for marriage records due to privacy laws. OCR-to-hash allows the **Individual** to carry a portable, verifiable proof of their status that only reveals data when the physical document is presented, respecting privacy while providing absolute trust.
