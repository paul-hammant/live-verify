## Data Verified

Author name, editor name, manuscript title, version ID (e.g., v2.4), SHA-256 hash of the submitted digital file, submission timestamp (to the second), total word count, copyright registration status, issuing publisher domain.

**Document Types:**
- **Manuscript Attestation:** Proving what was actually submitted.
- **Edit History Summary:** Documenting every authorized change.
- **Reader's Report:** (Linked hash) proving the editorial feedback.
- **Copyright Affidavit:** (Linked hash) proving original authorship.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`penguinrandomhouse.com`, `harpercollins.com`) and version standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Certified Original** — Version matches the author's initial submission.
- **Editorial Pass** — Revised version after publisher edits.
- **Final Galleys** — Version approved for typesetting and printing.
- **Retracted** — **ALERT:** Authorship or integrity dispute found.

## Second-Party Use

The **Author** benefits from verification.

**Copyright Defense:** Proving to a court or a rival author that their "Version 2.4" existed on March 15, 2026. A verified, timestamped hash from a major publisher's domain is the "Nuclear Option" evidence in plagiarism or "Idea Theft" lawsuits.

**Contractual Milestones:** Proving to an agent that the manuscript was "Verified Delivered" on time, triggering the next advance payment.

## Third-Party Use

**Literary Agents**
**Audit Integrity:** Verifying that the manuscript being sent to international sub-agents is the **exact verified version** authorized by the author, preventing "Version Skew" across different languages.

**Movie Studios / Producers**
**Chain of Title:** Before buying film rights, the studio verifies the "Manuscript Hash" to ensure they are basing the screenplay on the authorized, non-altered version of the book.

**Academic Researchers**
**Provenance Tracking:** For historical or high-value works, verifying the "Edit History" to understand the evolution of the text.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Manuscript Theft" Fraud Problem**

- **Idea Poaching:** A rogue editor or assistant stealing a manuscript and claiming they wrote it. Verification timestamps prove the original author's priority.
- **Silent Editing:** A publisher changing a controversial paragraph in a PDF after the author signed off, to avoid a legal risk.
- **Fabricated Submissions:** Someone creating a fake "Penguin Random House" receipt to trick an investor or agent into thinking they have a book deal.

**Issuer Types**

**Global Publishing Houses.**
**University Presses.**
**Self-Publishing Platforms:** (e.g., Kindle Direct, IngramSpark - hosting the hashes).

**Privacy Salt:** Critical. Manuscript titles and hashes are trade secrets. The hash MUST be salted to prevent competitors from "Guessing" the topics of upcoming high-profile books.

## Competition vs. Version Control (GitHub / Word Track Changes)

| Feature | OCR-to-Hash | Track Changes (Word) | GitHub (Version Control) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Legal Weight** | **High.** Binds to the Publisher domain. | **Low.** Easily scrubbed or edited. | **Medium.** Proves the *Tech*. |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Trust the House. | **Self-Reported.** | **Protocol-Bound.** |
| **Integrity** | **Cryptographic.** Binds the whole file. | **Vulnerable.** Metadata can be deleted. | **High.** |
| **Adoption** | **High.** Works for traditional non-tech authors. | **Universal.** | **Low.** Only for tech-savvy authors. |

**Why OCR wins here:** The "Traditional Industry" reality. Most authors use Microsoft Word or Scrivener, not GitHub. Most agents work with PDFs. OCR-to-hash turn the **Static PDF Manuscript** into a live digital anchor, providing "Software-Grade" integrity to the world of literature.
