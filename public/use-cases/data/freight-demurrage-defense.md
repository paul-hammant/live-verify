## What is FD&D Insurance?

In the world of giant cargo ships, a single delay at a port can cost $50,000 per day in **Demurrage** (late fees). Disputes over these fees can lead to multimillion-dollar lawsuits in London or Singapore.

**Freight, Demurrage & Defense (FD&D)** is "Legal War-Chest Insurance." It pays for the high-priced maritime lawyers needed to fight these cases.

Shipowners must prove they have this verified "Defense Cover" before they can hire top-tier barristers or release an arrested ship. Verified hashes allow lawyers and ports to check the **un-altered legal limits** on the P&I Club's domain instantly.

## Data Verified

Vessel name, IMO number, Member name, coverage class (FD&D), legal cost limits, effective dates, P&I Club ID, specific exclusions (if any), date of certificate issuance.

**Document Types:**
- **Certificate of Entry (FD&D):** Proving the vessel has legal "War Chest" insurance.
- **Letter of Undertaking (LOU):** (Linked hash) provided by the Club to release an arrested ship.
- **Rules of the Association:** (Linked hash) for the technical fine print.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`londonpandi.com`, `gard.no`, `skuld.com`) and membership standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **In Force** — Member is in good standing; calls paid.
- **Suspended** — Coverage paused (e.g., due to unpaid calls or sanction violation).
- **Withdrawn** — Ship has left the Club.
- **Lapsed** — Renewals not processed for current policy year.

## Second-Party Use

The **Shipowner / Member** benefits from verification.

**Arbitration Financing:** Proving to a maritime arbitrator or legal counsel that the vessel has verified FD&D coverage. This ensures that legal fees will be paid by the P&I Club, allowing the shipowner to pursue high-value claims (e.g., $5M in unpaid demurrage) without draining their own cash flow.

**Chartering Credibility:** Proving to a high-quality charterer (e.g., Shell or BP) that the vessel owner is a member of a "Group Club" with verified legal defense backing.

## Third-Party Use

**Maritime Attorneys / Barristers**
**Fee Assurance:** Before taking on a complex international charterparty dispute, the law firm scans the FD&D certificate. "Verified by The London Club" gives them the confidence that the P&I Club's "Cover for Legal Costs" is real and active.

**Admiralty Courts**
**Vessel Release:** Verifying the "Letter of Undertaking" hash before releasing a ship from arrest. OCR-to-hash prevents thieves from using a "Fake LOU" to flee a jurisdiction.

**Bunker Suppliers / Vendors**
**Credit Vetting:** Verifying the insurance quality of a counterparty before allowing a "Paid on Terms" supply of fuel.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Maritime Legal" Fraud Problem**

- **Fabricated Certificates:** Using a famous P&I Club's logo to create a fake "Certificate of Entry" to trick a port into releasing an arrested vessel.
- **Limit Inflation:** Editing a $1M "Small Craft" policy to read $10M to meet a charterer's requirements.
- **Backdating LOUs:** Creating a fake Letter of Undertaking to hide that a vessel is operating without legal backing.

**Issuer Types**

**International Group of P&I Clubs (IG):** (e.g., Gard, Skuld, UK Club, London Club).
**Specialist Legal Defense Underwriters.**
**Maritime Law Firms.**

## Competition vs. Club Member Search

| Feature | OCR-to-Hash | Club Website Search | Scanned PDF |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Integrity** | **Cryptographic.** Binds the *Legal Limit*. | **Vague.** Often only shows "Entered" without the limit details. | **Zero.** Easily forged. |
| **User Access** | **Universal.** Any attorney or port can verify. | **Restricted.** Some Clubs require private logins for detailed data. | **Instant.** |
| **Speed** | **Instant.** 5-second scan. | **Slow.** Requires IMO # search and UI navigation. | **N/A.** |
| **Authority** | **Domain-Bound.** Bound to the Club. | **High.** Direct DB. | **Medium.** |

**Why OCR wins here:** The "Bridge Moment." Maritime disputes happen at sea or in busy port offices. People don't want to struggle with a desktop-optimized P&I Club website. OCR-to-hash turns the **Physical Certificate** into a live, high-speed digital dashboard, providing the "Rule 26" level of trust needed for international legal proceedings.
