## Data Verified

Owner name, specific artwork title/artist, "Agreed Value" amount, coverage type (Nail-to-Nail), exhibition location(s), transit route, approved packing company ID, effective dates, issuing specialist syndicate.

**Document Types:**
- **Evidence of Insurance:** For museum loan committees.
- **Nail-to-Nail Transit Policy:** Covering the move from wall to truck to museum.
- **Title Insurance (Art):** Protecting against restitution or ownership claims.
- **Valuation Endorsement:** Linking a verified appraisal to the policy.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`axa-art.com`, `hiscox.com`, `chubb.com`) and policy status.

**Status Indications:**
- **In Force** — Premium paid; masterpiece covered.
- **Transit Active** — **ALERT:** The work is currently in the high-risk "Move" phase.
- **Terminated** — Coverage ended post-exhibition.
- **Claim Active** — Incident reported; under investigation.

## Second-Party Use

The **Art Owner (Collector / Museum)** benefits from verification.

**Museum Loans:** Proving to a lending museum (e.g., the Louvre) that their $85M Monet is "Verified Insured" for the entire trip. Museums won't release masterpieces without 100% cryptographic certainty that the insurance is real and active.

**Collateralized Finance:** Proving to a private bank that the art serving as collateral for a $50M loan is fully protected by a verified "All-Risk" policy.

## Third-Party Use

**Museum Registrars**
**Intake Integrity:** Before unpacking a crate, the museum registrar scans the insurance certificate. "Verified by AXA" ensures the owner hasn't "Self-Edited" the limits or excluded "Transit" coverage to save money.

**Fine Art Logisticians (Crozier / Hasenkamp)**
**Handoff Security:** Verifying that the insurance is active before they take physical possession of the crate, reducing their own corporate liability.

**Customs (Cultural Property)**
**Export Vetting:** Ensuring that a high-value work being exported has the verified insurance required for international movement of national treasures.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Vanishing Masterpiece" Fraud Problem**

- **Value Inflation:** Editing an agreed value from $8.5M to $85M to trick a bank into an over-leveraged loan.
- **Exclusion Concealment:** Deleting the line that excludes "Earthquake" or "Flood" before sending the policy to a museum in California or Venice.
- **Ghost Policies:** Using fake Lloyd's letterhead to claim a work is insured to avoid the high cost of actual fine-art premiums.

**Issuer Types**

**Specialty Art Carriers:** (AXA Art, Hiscox, Chubb, Berkley).
**Lloyd's Syndicates.**
**Art-Specific MGAs.**

## Competition vs. Physical Provenance Logs

| Feature | OCR-to-Hash | Provenance Log (Paper) | Art Registry (Blockchain) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Integrity** | **Binds Value.** Protects the $85M claim. | **Subjective.** Relies on old stickers/notes. | **High.** But art is off-chain. |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Trust the Payer. | **Signature-Bound.** | **Consensus-Bound.** |
| **Hardware** | **Universal.** Any smartphone. | **Expert.** Requires magnifying glass/knowledge. | **Technical.** Requires crypto-wallet. |
| **Speed** | **Instant.** 5-second scan. | **Slow.** Hours of expert review. | **Fast.** |

**Why OCR wins here:** The "Handoff Momentum." High-end art moves in a small circle of trusted registrars and handlers. They don't have time for "Crypto-Onboarding." OCR-to-hash turns the **Standard Insurance Folder** into a live digital anchor that matches the speed and prestige of the global art market.
