## Data Verified

Artist name, title of work, year, medium, total edition size (e.g., 50), specific print number (e.g., 14), number of Artist Proofs (APs), publisher name, registry number.

**Document Types:**
- **Edition Certificate:** Issued with the physical print or sculpture.
- **Inventory Receipt:** For gallery internal tracking.
- **Sculpture Casting Certificate:** Proving the foundry used an authorized mold.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`pacegallery.com`, `tate.org.uk`) and the status of that specific number.

**Status Indications:**
- **Authorized** — Number matches the publisher's official record.
- **Sold Out** — Edition complete; no more numbers will be issued.
- **Destroyed/Withdrawn** — The specific numbered piece was reported destroyed (important for insurance).
- **Duplicate Alert** — Another party has already verified/claimed this specific number (fraud detection).

## Second-Party Use

The **Collector** benefits from verification.

**Value Protection:** Proving that the print is 14/50 and not an "unauthorized extra" run by the printer (backdoor editions). A verified limited edition holds its value; a "leaked" print does not.

**Insurance Claims:** If print 14/50 is lost in a fire, the verified certificate proves its scarcity and value to the insurance adjuster.

## Third-Party Use

**Auction Houses**
**Cataloging:** Specialists verify that the print number being consigned matches the known characteristics of that edition (e.g., paper type, dimensions) listed in the publisher's hash.

**Customs (Import/Export)**
**Duty Classification:** Original prints (limited editions < 50 or < 100) often have lower import duties than generic posters. Verification proves the "original art" status to border agents.

**Online Marketplaces (eBay/Artsper)**
**Trust Badge:** Sellers can include the "Verified by Pace" link in their listing to prevent buyers from worrying about "fake numbers."

## Verification Architecture

**The "Extra Run" Fraud Problem**

- **Ghost Editions:** A publisher authorized for 50 prints actually runs 100, selling the extra 50 "under the table" with duplicated numbers or "Artist Proof" designations.
- **Number Tampering:** Changing a high number (48/50) to a more desirable low number (1/50) using a pencil and eraser.
- **Color Photocopies:** Selling high-quality scans of an original print as if they were part of the numbered edition.

**Issuer Types**

**Galleries/Publishers:** (Pace Editions, Gemini G.E.L., Crown Point Press).
**Foundries:** (For bronze sculptures).
**Artist Estates:** (Managing posthumous editions).

## Competition vs. Physical Holograms

| Feature | OCR-to-Hash | Hologram Sticker | Blind Stamp (Embossing) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Integrity** | **Binds Content.** Hash protects the *Number* and *Artist Name*. | **Binds Paper.** Proves the paper is real, but not what is written on it. | **Physical.** Hard to forge, but can be faked with a custom die. |
| **Registry Link** | **Direct.** Links instantly to the publisher's database. | **Manual.** Requires looking up a serial number on a website. | **None.** Just a mark on the paper. |
| **Durability** | **Archival.** Ink/pencil text lasts centuries. | **Fragile.** Stickers peel off or degrade over time. | **Durable.** But can be flattened. |

**Why OCR wins here:** Limited editions are all about **Math**. Is the denominator (total size) real? Is the numerator (my number) unique? OCR-to-hash connects the physical number written in pencil to the publisher's official spreadsheet, ensuring the math stays honest.
