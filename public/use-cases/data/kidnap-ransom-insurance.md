## Data Verified

Insured entity name, aggregate ransom limit, individual sub-limits, crisis response firm name (e.g., Control Risks, NYA), effective/expiration dates, covered individuals (Class/Title), territory inclusions, underwriter ID.

**Document Types:**
- **Evidence of Coverage:** Proving the company can pay for a response team.
- **Crisis Response Protocol:** (Linked hash) for the security director.
- **Ransom Fund Authorization:** Verified proof of funds for emergency payout.
- **Proof of Life Questionnaire:** (Linked hash) from the response firm.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`hiscox.com`, `beazley.com`, `chubb.com`) and current policy standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **In Force** — Premium paid; policy active.
- **Response Authorized** — **ALERT:** Insurer has activated the crisis team for a specific event.
- **Cancelled** — Policy terminated (Extreme risk for executives in the field).
- **Lapsed** — Term ended; no renewal found.

## Second-Party Use

The **Corporate Security Director** benefits from verification.

**Emergency Activation:** Proving to a local response team in a foreign country (e.g., Mexico or Nigeria) that the "Crisis Policy" is verified active. This allows the specialized negotiators (like Control Risks) to deploy instantly without waiting for a finance clerk to authorize the multi-million dollar "Daily Response Fee."

**Executive Protection:** Reassuring high-profile executives traveling to high-risk zones that their "Safety Net" is verified and the ransom fund is cryptographically backed by a top-tier insurer.

## Third-Party Use

**Crisis Response Firms (Control Risks / Mandiant)**
**Authorization Check:** Before putting a specialized team on a plane to a dangerous region, the firm scans the policy hash. "Verified by Hiscox" ensures the carrier is actually on the hook for the team's massive consulting and ransom costs.

**Banks (Funds for Ransom)**
**Withdrawal Proof:** Verifying the "Ransom Fund Authorization" before releasing a high-value cash or crypto withdrawal intended for a kidnapper settlement.

**Government Agencies (FBI / MI6)**
**Coordination:** Verifying the insurance and response status of a corporate kidnapping case without needing to see the private policy documents.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Confidentiality" Fraud Problem**

- **Ghost Policies:** A company telling an executive "You are covered for $10M" to keep them working in a dangerous country, but never actually paying the premium. Verification allows the executive to check the hash privately.
- **Limit Padding:** Editing a $1M "Limited" policy to read $10M to meet a contract's safety requirement.
- **Response Firm Misrepresentation:** Claiming to have "Control Risks" on retainer when the actual verified policy only covers a local, un-vetted security firm.

**Issuer Types**

**Global Crisis Underwriters:** (Hiscox, Beazley, Chubb, AIG).
**Specialist Brokers:** (Marsh, Aon - Executive Risk units).
**Response Firms:** (Control Risks, NYA - who co-sign the activation hashes).

**Privacy Salt:** ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL. K&R data is the most sensitive data in the insurance industry. The hash MUST be salted to prevent "Guess-and-Check" searches to see which companies have ransom insurance (making them targets for kidnappers).

## Competition vs. Secure Portals

| Feature | OCR-to-Hash | Secure Underwriter Portal | Scanned PDF |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Integrity** | **Cryptographic.** Binds the *Ransom Limit*. | **System-Bound.** | **Zero.** Easily forged. |
| **Privacy** | **High.** Verification happens without a login. | **Low.** Portal access often reveals full policy/history. | **Medium.** |
| **Field Access** | **Instant.** Scan the paper in the safe. | **Difficult.** Requires laptop/stable 5G. | **Instant.** |
| **Freshness** | **Real-time.** Shows if cancelled *today*. | **Live.** | **Static.** |

**Why OCR wins here:** The "Hostage Moment." K&R decisions happen in 15 minutes in dark rooms. People are terrified. They don't want to struggle with a complex portal login or a forgotten password. OCR-to-hash turns the **Physical Confirmation Letter** (kept in the company safe) into a live, high-authority digital artifact that triggers the response team instantly.
