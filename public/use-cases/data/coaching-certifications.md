## What is a Coaching License?

In professional and youth sports, a **Coaching License** is more than just a proof of technical skill. It is a "Safety Credential."

To get one, a coach must:
1.  **Pass a Background Check:** Screened against sex-offender and criminal registries.
2.  **Complete SafeSport Training:** Education on preventing abuse and bullying.
3.  **Demonstrate Technical Skill:** Tactical knowledge of the sport.

Parents and clubs use these badges to ensure that the adult on the sideline is a "Verified Safe" professional who has met national standards.

## Data Verified

Coach name, photo (hash), license level (Grassroots, D, C, B, A, PRO), issuing federation, effective date, expiration date, SafeSport compliance status, background check clearance status.

**Document Types:**
- **Coaching License:** The formal credential for the wall/portfolio.
- **SafeSport Certificate:** Proof of mandatory abuse-prevention training.
- **Background Check Result:** Essential for youth sports eligibility.
- **Continuing Education (CE) Unit:** Proving the coach is keeping up with standards.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`ussoccer.com`, `ncaa.org`) and current standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Eligible** — License active; all safety requirements met.
- **Suspended** — Disciplinary action or lapsed background check.
- **Expired** — License renewal or safety training required.
- **Revoked** — Permanently barred from coaching (SafeSport violation).

## Second-Party Use

The **Coach** benefits from verification.

**Job Placement:** Proving to a prestigious academy or college program that their "National A License" claim is authentic. This distinguishes the coach from "Resume Padders" who exaggerate their qualifications.

**Club Onboarding:** Speeding up the annual club registration process by providing a "Verified Safety Token" that proves they've already passed their background check and SafeSport training.

## Third-Party Use

**Parents / Guardians**
**Youth Safety:** Before dropping a child at a new soccer camp, a parent can scan the coach's badge. "Verified by U.S. Soccer" provides instant, authoritative proof that the coach is background-checked and SafeSport compliant.

**Club Directors**
**Risk Management:** Ensuring that 100% of their coaching staff is verified eligible before the season starts, protecting the club from massive liability and insurance cancellation.

**Tournament Organizers**
**Sideline Verification:** Checking the credentials of coaches on the bench during a national tournament to ensure only authorized personnel are in the technical area.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Fake Coach" Fraud Problem**

- **SafeSport Concealment:** A coach banned for misconduct in one state moving to another state and using a fake or old license to get a job.
- **Credential Inflation:** Changing a "Grassroots" license to a "National B" license on a PDF to qualify for a higher-paying job.
- **Identity Theft:** Using a real, high-level coach's name and license number to launch a fake training academy.

**Issuer Types**

**National Governing Bodies (NGBs):** (U.S. Soccer, USA Swimming, USA Gymnastics).
**U.S. Center for SafeSport.**
**Collegiate Orgs:** (NCAA, NAIA).

**Privacy Salt:** Critical. Coaching records include sensitive safety/legal data. The hash must be salted to prevent "Guess-and-Check" searches for barred individuals.

## Competition vs. Learning Portals (USSF Learning Center)

| Feature | OCR-to-Hash | Learning Portal (Login) | Physical License / ID |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Bound to the Federation. | **System-Bound.** Requires login. | **Visual.** Trusted only via stamp. |
| **Sideline Access** | **Instant.** Scan the coach's lanyard. | **Hard.** No one logs into a portal on a muddy field. | **Instant.** |
| **Integrity** | **Cryptographic.** Binds photo to status. | **High.** Direct DB access. | **Low.** Easily faked. |
| **User Control** | **High.** Coach shares only the Badge. | **Low.** Portal exposes full academic history. | **High.** |

**Why OCR wins here:** The "Sideline Audit." Soccer tournaments happen on remote fields with 50 teams at once. Officials need a high-speed, mobile-first way to verify that every adult on the sideline is a "Verified Safe" professional. OCR-to-hash turns the **Coach's Lanyard** into a live, trusted security token.
