## What is a Capital Adequacy Attestation?

In the banking and insurance sectors, **Capital Adequacy** is the measure of a firm's "Safety Buffer." It defines the amount of liquid capital a firm must hold to absorb unexpected losses. A **Capital Adequacy Attestation** is a formal document, usually signed by the CFO and an external auditor, proving the firm meets the minimum regulatory requirements (e.g., Basel III CET1 ratios).

These documents are the "Proof of Solvency" needed for high-stakes business. Counterparties (other banks) and large institutional clients demand these attestations before entering into multi-billion dollar derivative or custody contracts. Fraud is high-stakes: a struggling firm might "edit" a ratio from 7% (critically low) to 12% (healthy) to prevent a "run on the bank" or to secure a partnership. Verified hashes bind the **CET1 Ratio, Buffer Compliance, and Auditor's Signature** to the firm's or the regulator's domain.

## Data Verified

Firm name, regulatory ID (FRN/CRD), attestation date (quarterly), CET1 Ratio, Tier 1 Capital Ratio, Total Capital Ratio, LCR (Liquidity Coverage Ratio), buffer compliance status, CFO name/signature, external auditor name/ID.

**Document Types:**
- **Capital Adequacy Attestation:** The primary quarterly summary.
- **Pillar 3 Disclosure:** (Linked hash) the public transparency report.
- **ICAAP Summary:** The Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment.
- **Auditor's Comfort Letter:** Proof the math was independently checked.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`meridian-capital.com`, `gs.com`, `fca.org.uk`) and the solvency standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Confirmed / Compliant** — Ratios match the firm's certified regulatory filing.
- **Superseded** — **ALERT:** A newer quarterly attestation is available.
- **Breach Alert** — **CRITICAL:** The firm has reported a capital buffer breach to the regulator.
- **Under Review** — **ALERT:** The reported ratios are subject to a regulatory audit.

## Second-Party Use

The **Firm's Treasury / Compliance Dept** benefits from verification.

**Counterparty Trust:** When entering a $100M currency swap with another bank, the Treasury team provides the verified "Capital Hash." The counterparty can instantly see **"VERIFIED 14.2% CET1"** on their phone, removing the "Counterparty Risk" fear and allowing the trade to execute without a 2-day manual credit review.

**Investor Relations:** Providing verified hashes of solvency data to large institutional investors (Pension Funds) to maintain "Investment Grade" trust during market volatility.

## Third-Party Use

**Counterparty Banks / Clearing Houses**
**Credit Limit Setting:** Automatically monitoring the verified capital hashes of all 50 partner banks in a trading network. If a partner's hash returns **"BREACH ALERT,"** the system can instantly freeze their credit lines to prevent systemic contagion.

**Regulatory Auditors**
**Integrity Audit:** During a routine exam, the regulator scans the attestations provided to clients. OCR-to-hash ensures the bank isn't "Providing higher ratios to clients" than they are "Reporting to the Regulator."

**Corporate Clients**
**Custody Vetting:** Before depositing $500M in a custody account, a corporate treasurer verifies the bank's capital adequacy hash to ensure the funds are being held by a stable, well-capitalized institution.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Window Dressing" Fraud Problem**

- **Ratio Inflation:** Manually editing a "7.5%" ratio to "12.5%" on a PDF to bypass a counterparty's minimum threshold.
- **Buffer Masking:** Removing a footnote that mentions a "temporary capital waiver" granted by the regulator.
- **Stale Data:** Presenting a "Healthy" Q1 attestation in Q3 after a major market loss has wiped out the capital.

**Issuer Types**

**Global Investment Banks.**
**Prudential Regulators (Fed, PRA, ECB).**
**Audit Firms (Big 4).**

**Privacy Salt:** Highly Critical. Exact capital amounts and internal buffer strategies are highly sensitive "Market-Moving" data. The hash must be salted and access restricted to authorized financial institutions.

## Rationale

Capital adequacy is the "Foundation of Financial Stability." By turning technical attestations into verifiable digital bridges, we protect the banking system from the "Minsky Moment" of hidden insolvency and ensure that "Safety" is backed by cryptographic proof.
