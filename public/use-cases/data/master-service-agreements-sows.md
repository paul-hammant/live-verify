## Data Verified

Client name, Provider name, Agreement ID, execution date, specific liability limit amount, termination notice period, governing law jurisdiction, authorized signatories, page count of full contract.

**Document Types:**
- **Master Service Agreement (MSA):** The primary legal framework.
- **Statement of Work (SOW):** (Linked hash) for specific project details.
- **Change Order:** Documenting verified modifications to a project.
- **Mutual NDA:** (Linked hash) protecting trade secrets.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (e.g., the Provider's or Client's Legal Dept) and current status.

**Status Indications:**
- **Active/Executed** — Agreement is signed and in effect.
- **Terminated** — **ALERT:** Contract has ended; no new SOWs authorized.
- **Amended** — A newer version of the MSA exists (view Amendment #3).
- **In-Dispute** — Contract terms are being formally litigated.

## Second-Party Use

The **Procurement / Legal Team** benefits from verification.

**Anti-Tampering:** Ensuring that a "Last Minute Change" wasn't snuck into the PDF by a negotiator after the final version was agreed upon. OCR-to-hash turn every page of the 50-page MSA into an immutable digital anchor, protecting the "Liability Caps" and "IP Rights" from silent editing.

**Internal Audit:** Proving to the CFO that the contract being paid against is the **Verified Official Version** approved by General Counsel.

## Third-Party Use

**Insurance Underwriters (E&O)**
**Risk Assessment:** Verifying the "Liability Limits" in a client's major MSAs before writing a professional liability policy. If the paper says "$1M cap" but the verified hash says "$10M," the insurer avoids an under-priced risk.

**M&A Due Diligence**
**Revenue Audit:** A buyer of a company can instantly verify the "Change-of-Control" and "Termination" clauses across 1,000+ client MSAs by scanning their hashes, reducing the time for manual legal review.

**Banks / Factorers**
**Contract Integrity:** Verifying the existence of an MSA before advancing cash against an SOW invoice.

## Verification Architecture

**The "PDF Redline" Fraud Problem**

- **Liability Cap Removal:** A client editing the PDF to remove the "$1M cap," making the provider potentially liable for the entire value of a data breach.
- **Termination Backdating:** Fabricating a "Notice of Termination" from 3 months ago to avoid paying a current invoice.
- **Unauthorized SOWs:** Creating a fake Statement of Work that looks like it's covered by a real MSA to trick a department head into approving a project.

**Issuer Types**

**Corporate Legal Depts:** (Hosting on their own `/legal` domain).
**Law Firms:** (e.g., Wilson Sonsini, Cooley - hosting for clients).
**Contract Platforms:** (e.g., Ironclad, Icertis, DocuSign - hosting the hashes).

## Competition vs. CLM Systems (Ironclad)

| Feature | OCR-to-Hash | CLM (Contract Lifecycle Mgmt) | Scanned PDF / Email |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Interoperability** | **Universal.** PDFs work across all companies. | **Low.** Hard to verify if you don't use the same CLM. | **Universal.** |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Bound to the Party. | **System-Bound.** Trust the vendor. | **Zero.** Easily forged. |
| **Integrity** | **Binds Content.** Protects the "Fine Print." | **Data-Only.** | **Vulnerable.** |
| **Cost** | **Low.** Standard web infra. | **Very High.** Enterprise license fees. | **None.** |

**Why OCR wins here:** The "External Audit" reality. Contracts move between organizations. You can't give every potential buyer or insurer a login to your private Ironclad portal. OCR-to-hash turns the **Static Signed PDF** into a portable, cryptographically trusted asset that carries its own proof of truth across organizational borders.
