## What are Shore Excursion Receipts?

When a cruise ship docks at a port (e.g., Cozumel or Santorini), thousands of passengers disembark for "Shore Excursions"—from scuba diving to bus tours. These tickets are high-value vouchers, often costing $150 to $500 per person.

Fraud is common in the "Port Market." Unlicensed tour operators create fake "Official Cruise Line" tickets to trick passengers into boarding unsafe vehicles. Similarly, passengers sometimes "edit" a receipt to claim a refund for a tour they actually attended. Verified hashes bind the **Excursion Name, Ship/Cabin Number, and Date** to the cruise line's or the operator's domain (e.g., `royalcaribbean.com` or `viator.com`).

## Data Verified

Excursion name, port of call, date, guest name, cabin number, booking reference, price, meeting time, tour operator name, waiver status (linked hash).

**Document Types:**
- **Shore Excursion Ticket:** The physical pass used to board the bus/boat.
- **Booking Confirmation:** Emailed proof of purchase.
- **Refund Voucher:** Issued if a tour is cancelled due to weather.
- **Liability Waiver:** (Linked hash) signed by the guest.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`carnival.com`, `rccl.com`, `viator.com`) and the ticket standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Confirmed / Paid** — Ticket is valid; passenger is on the manifest.
- **Checked In** — Passenger has boarded the excursion.
- **Cancelled (Weather)** — **ALERT:** Excursion voided due to conditions; refund active.
- **Voided** — **ALERT:** Ticket reported lost or stolen.

## Second-Party Use

The **Cruise Passenger** benefits from verification.

**Anti-Scam Protection:** A passenger standing on a busy pier is approached by a "Tour Guide" claiming to be their official cruise contact. The passenger scans the guide's clipboard hash. If it returns **"VERIFIED - CARNIVAL VOYAGER,"** they can board the bus safely. If it returns **"UNKNOWN,"** they know it's an unlicensed operator.

**Refund Disputes:** If an excursion is "shortened" or doesn't deliver the promised activities (e.g., no ruins, just a gift shop), the passenger can use the verified hash of the original itinerary to prove they didn't get what they paid for when filing a claim with the ship's ShoreEx desk.

## Third-Party Use

**Port Security / Authorities**
**Crowd Control:** Verifying the identity of tour operators allowed onto the restricted "Cruise Pier" by scanning their verified manifest hashes.

**Travel Insurance Underwriters**
**Injury Claims:** If a passenger is injured on an excursion, the insurer verifies the ticket. "Verified by Carnival" ensures the tour was an authorized, insured activity and not a "rogue" tour that would void the passenger's medical coverage.

**Cruise Line Revenue Audit**
**Operator Reconciliation:** Verifying that the number of passengers who actually boarded the bus (scanned hashes) matches what the local tour operator is billing the cruise line for.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Pier-Side Pitch" Fraud Problem**

- **Logo Mimicry:** Unlicensed operators using a cruise line's logo on fake tickets to lure passengers into unsafe boats.
- **Manifest Padding:** Operators adding "Ghost Passengers" to their paper logs to over-charge the cruise line.
- **Waiver Hiding:** Editing a liability waiver to remove the "Risk Disclosure" section before a lawsuit.

**Issuer Types**

**Cruise Line ShoreEx Departments.**
**Large Tour Aggregators (e.g., Viator, ShoreExcursionsGroup).**
**Local Port Authorities.**

**Privacy Salt:** Essential. Cabin numbers and passenger names are private travel data. The hash must be salted to prevent "Passenger Tracking" by data scrapers at the port.

## Rationale

Shore excursions are high-risk "Off-Ship" events. By turning tickets into verifiable digital bridges, we create a "Shield of Trust" that protects passengers from scams and ensures that operators are held to the safety standards of the cruise brand.
