## What is a Refugee Travel Document?

A **Refugee Travel Document (Form I-571)** is a passport-style booklet issued to a person who has refugee or asylee status in the US and cannot obtain a passport from their home country. It is their only legal "Ticket to the World" and their only way to return to the United States.

For a refugee, this document is a fragile lifeline. If an airline agent in a foreign airport (e.g., in Turkey or Jordan) doesn't recognize the blue booklet or think it looks "fake," the traveler can be stranded in a dangerous location. Verified hashes bind the **Document ID, Validity Dates, and Holder's Photo** to the `uscis.gov` domain, providing global authorities with an instant way to trust the document.

## Data Verified

Document number (RT prefix), holder's full name, date of birth, country of birth, sex, date of issuance, date of expiration, photograph (via hash), USCIS alien registration number (A-Number), issuing office.

**Document Types:**
- **Refugee Travel Document:** (I-571) Blue booklet.
- **Re-Entry Permit:** (I-327) White booklet for Green Card holders.
- **Form I-512L:** Advance Parole (Paper sheet).
- **Consular Return Letter:** (Linked hash) for emergency re-entry.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`uscis.gov`) and the document standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Valid / Current** — Document is authentic and authorized for international travel.
- **Revoked** — **CRITICAL:** Status has been terminated (e.g., due to denied asylum or criminal acts).
- **Expired** — **ALERT:** The validity period has lapsed; re-entry may be denied.
- **Lost/Stolen Flag** — **ALERT:** This document number has been reported missing.

## Second-Party Use

The **Refugee / Asylee (Traveler)** benefits from verification.

**Secure Boarding:** A traveler in a remote airport can show the verified hash to the airline check-in agent. The agent can instantly see **"VALID - USCIS"** on their phone, removing the "fake document" fear that often leads to refugees being wrongfully denied boarding on the way home to the US.

**Proof of Status:** When checking into a hotel or renting a car abroad, the traveler can use the verified hash to prove their legal status in the US, providing a higher level of trust than a mere physical booklet.

## Third-Party Use

**Airlines / Carrier Security**
**Sanction Prevention:** Airlines are fined $5,000+ for every "Inadmissible" passenger they fly to the US. OCR-to-hash allows them to instantly verify the booklet's authenticity, protecting the airline's revenue and the traveler's journey.

**Foreign Border Police**
**Identity Vetting:** Verifying that the photo on the physical booklet matches the digital record in the US database, stopping the common "Photo-Swap" fraud used for illegal border crossings.

**International Banks**
**KYC Compliance:** Using the verified Refugee Travel Document as a secondary form of identity for account opening for individuals without a home-country passport.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Stateless Scam" Fraud Problem**

- **Photo Substitution:** Replacing the original photo in the booklet with a lookalike's photo.
- **Revocation Hiding:** A person whose refugee status was revoked (e.g., for fraud) keeping their physical booklet to continue traveling or to hide their "Inadmissible" status.
- **Date Stretching:** Altering the 1-year expiration date to 2 years to avoid the high cost of renewal.

**Issuer Types**

**U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS).**
**United Nations (UNHCR) - for Travel Docs issued by other nations.**
**Consular Posts (Department of State).**

**Privacy Salt:** Highly Critical. Refugee data is subject to extreme privacy protections due to the risk of "Transnational Repression" by their home countries. The hash must be salted and access restricted to authorized port-of-entry partners.

## Rationale

Refugee travel is "High-Stakes Mobility." By turning travel booklets into verifiable digital bridges, we protect the most vulnerable travelers from administrative errors and ensure that "Freedom of Movement" is backed by cryptographic proof.
