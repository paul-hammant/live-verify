## What is a Disability Calculation?

If a professional (like a doctor or pilot) becomes disabled and can't work, their insurance pays them a monthly check.

The **Benefit Calculation Worksheet** is the actuarial math showing how the insurer reached that number. It isn't just "60% of salary"—it includes complex subtractions for Social Security, Workers Comp, and "Own-Occupation" rules.

Claimants use these verified worksheets to prove their income to banks for mortgages. Fraud happens when people "Edit" the worksheet to show a higher monthly benefit to get a bigger loan. Verified hashes link the lender directly to the insurer's official calculation.

## Data Verified

Insured name, monthly benefit amount, pre-disability earnings base, benefit percentage, offsets applied (SSDI, Workers Comp), elimination period duration, max benefit age, claim status, certifying actuary/adjuster.

**Document Types:**
- **Benefit Calculation Worksheet:** The breakdown of how the $6,300 was reached.
- **Explanation of Benefits (EOB):** Post-approval payment schedule.
- **Return to Work Authorization:** (Linked hash) for partial disability benefits.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`metlife.com`, `unum.com`) and current claim standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Active** — Payments authorized and ongoing.
- **Under Review** — Annual recertification of disability pending.
- **Closed/Settled** — Claim terminated (e.g., reached max age or recovered).
- **In-Litigation** — Benefit amount is being formally disputed.

## Second-Party Use

The **Policyholder** benefits from verification.

**Mortgage Approval:** Proving to a lender that their $6,300/month disability income is a verified, stable, long-term asset. Banks are often skeptical of "Self-Reported" disability income; a verified hash from the insurer removes this doubt.

**Alimony/Child Support:** Proving verified income levels in a family court proceeding to ensure fair support calculations based on actual insurance payouts.

## Third-Party Use

**Mortgage Underwriters**
**Asset Integrity:** Lenders verify the "Benefit Period." If the paper says "To Age 65" but the hash says "Max 2 Years," the lender avoids a high-risk loan.

**Social Security Administration (SSA)**
**Offset Reconciliation:** Verifying the private disability amount to calculate the correct SSDI offset, preventing overpayments.

**Credit Counselors**
**Debt Restructuring:** Verifying the consumer's income stability before negotiating with creditors.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Benefit Padding" Fraud Problem**

- **Amount Inflation:** Editing a $2,300 monthly benefit to read $6,300 to qualify for a larger car or home loan.
- **Duration Alteration:** Changing a "2-year limit" to "Lifetime" coverage on the PDF.
- **Offset Deletion:** Removing the "Social Security Offset" line from the calculation to make the net income look higher.

**Issuer Types**

**Group Carriers:** (MetLife, Prudential, Hartford).
**Individual Income Protection Firms:** (Unum, Guardian).
**Actuarial Audit Firms:** (Providing 3rd party certification).

## Competition vs. Employment Verification (The Work Number)

| Feature | OCR-to-Hash | Equifax (The Work Number) | Scanned PDF |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Bound to the Carrier. | **Data-Bound.** Trust the aggregator. | **Zero.** Easily forged. |
| **Completeness** | **High.** Shows specific policy triggers. | **Low.** Often only shows "Salary" or "Active/Inactive." | **Full.** |
| **User Privacy** | **High.** Only this specific claim is verified. | **Low.** Lenders see full employment history. | **High.** |
| **Speed** | **Instant.** Scan the worksheet. | **Slow.** Requires specific lender credentials and fees. | **Instant.** |

**Why OCR wins here:** Specificity. Employment verification services are built for workers, not claimants. They often miss the nuanced "Own-Occ" vs "Any-Occ" triggers that determine if a disability benefit will continue. OCR-to-hash turns the **Actuarial Worksheet** into a live, trusted link to the specific contract terms.
