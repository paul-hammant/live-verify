## What is Platform Lending?

In the e-commerce economy, platforms like **Shopify**, **Amazon**, and **Square** know a merchant's daily sales volume better than any bank. They use this data to offer "Instant Financing"—often called **Merchant Cash Advances (MCA)** or Revenue-Based Financing. These are not traditional loans; they are the purchase of future sales at a discount.

These digital agreements are the "Lien on Future Revenue." Fraud is rampant in the "Stacked Debt" market: a merchant might "edit" a Shopify agreement to hide that they already owe $50,000 to Amazon, allowing them to take out another illegal loan they can't afford. Similarly, they might use a fake "Satisfied" letter to hide an active lien. Verified hashes bind the **Advance Amount, Repayment Percentage, and Total Payback** to the platform's domain (e.g., `shopify.com` or `amazon.com`).

## Data Verified

Merchant ID, business legal name, advance ID, funding date, amount advanced (net), total repayment amount (gross), daily remittance percentage, platform name, primary bank account ID (for sweeping), date of UCC-1 filing.

**Document Types:**
- **Financing Agreement:** The primary legal contract.
- **Approval Advice:** (Linked hash) the pre-funding offer.
- **Payoff Confirmation:** Proof that the revenue-share is complete.
- **Daily Remittance Log:** (Linked hash) proving ongoing payments.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`shopify.com`, `amazon.com`, `square.com`) and the financing standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Active / Repaying** — The agreement is valid and funds are being collected daily.
- **Satisfied / Closed** — **ALERT:** The total amount has been repaid; no active lien.
- **In Default** — **CRITICAL:** Merchant has blocked the platform's access to funds.
- **Stacked Debt Alert** — **ALERT:** Multiple active financing agreements detected for this merchant.

## Second-Party Use

The **Merchant** (second party) receives the financing agreement from the platform (first party), **keeps it**, and may later hand it to third parties for various reasons, or never do so.

**Personal Record:** The merchant has their own verified copy of the financing terms. Most of the time, the document sits in their business records—the verification value is latent, there *if needed*.

**Peace of Mind:** The merchant can confirm at any time that the agreement matches what the platform's system recorded and hasn't been altered since they received it.

**Future Optionality:** If a dispute arises—whether about repayment amounts, remittance rates, or early payoff calculations—the merchant has cryptographic proof ready without needing to contact the platform.

## Third-Party Use

The merchant (second party) may hand the verified document to various third parties:

**Alternative Lenders (Secondary Financing)**
A merchant who has almost paid off their Shopify advance provides the verified hash to a second lender. The lender can see **"VERIFIED BALANCE: $2,500 REMAINING"** instantly, allowing them to pre-approve a new loan that closes the moment the first one finishes—without calling Shopify.

**Business Buyers (Exit / M&A)**
When selling an e-commerce store, the owner provides verified hashes of all platform debt. "Verified by Shopify" ensures the buyer there are no hidden liens on revenue, allowing the deal to close with cryptographic certainty. Brokers can verify that "Net Income" accurately reflects the cost of capital.

**Factoring Firms (Lien Priority)**
Before advancing against receivables, the factoring firm verifies the exact date of the platform's UCC filing to ensure their own "First Position" status isn't compromised by an undisclosed platform advance.

**Financial Regulators (Complaint / Investigation)**
The merchant submits verified agreements as part of a regulatory complaint about predatory lending terms. The regulator can confirm the exact terms agreed—the platform cannot claim "we never offered that rate."

## Verification Architecture

**The "Phantom Payoff" Fraud Problem**

- **Lien Hiding:** Editing a PDF to turn a "15% Remittance" into a "5% Remittance" to appear more creditworthy.
- **Ghost Payoffs:** Creating a fake "Success" email from Shopify to hide an active $100,000 debt.
- **Identity Mimicry:** Using a high-performing store's ID to cover for a failing store's loan application.

**Issuer Types (First Party)**

- Global E-commerce Platforms (Shopify, Amazon, eBay)
- Point-of-Sale (POS) Providers (Square, Toast, Clover)
- B2B Buy-Now-Pay-Later (BNPL) Firms

**Privacy Salt:** Required. Unlike documents with many unpredictable variables, platform lending agreements contain enumerable values—round dollar amounts, standard percentage tiers (5%, 10%, 15%), and publicly known merchant storefronts. A competitor could feasibly enumerate combinations to reverse-engineer a rival's debt position and gain unfair market intelligence. Salt protects these trade secrets.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing

A jurisdiction may require platforms offering merchant financing to retain a **witnessing firm** for regulatory compliance. The witnessing firm:

- Receives all hashes from the platform, and any subsequent changes to the agreement as they happen—which may manifest as a new hash, a status change (satisfied, default), or even a 404 (record deleted)
- Receives structured content/metadata (amounts, percentages, dates, UCC filing numbers)
- Does **NOT** receive plaintext (merchant names, bank account details)
- Provides an immutable, timestamped audit trail—available to the jurisdiction on demand, to merchants/third parties during disputes, or as expert witness testimony in legal proceedings

This provides:
- **Non-repudiation:** Platform cannot deny issuing the financing terms
- **Timestamp proof:** Agreement hash existed at a specific time (critical for UCC priority)
- **Regulatory audit:** State banking commissions can inspect the witness ledger for predatory lending patterns
- **Resilience:** Verification works even if platform's systems go down or the platform exits the market

**Public Blockchain (Non-Party)**

Witnessing firms may periodically commit rollups to an inexpensive public blockchain, providing an ultimate immutability guarantee. The blockchain is a "non-party"—infrastructure, not a participant in the transaction. This creates multiple verification paths:

1. **Platform domain** — Direct check against the issuer
2. **Witnessing firm** — Independent confirmation with timestamp
3. **Public blockchain** — Decentralized trust anchor via rollup inclusion

## Rationale

Platform lending is the "High-Speed Credit" of the digital age. By turning digital agreements into verifiable digital bridges, we protect the stability of the small-business credit market and ensure that "Financial Health" is based on the digital truth of the ledger, not the creative editing of a PDF.
