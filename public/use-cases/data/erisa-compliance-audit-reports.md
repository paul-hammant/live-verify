## What is an ERISA Audit?

If a company has a 401(k) or pension plan with more than 100 people, the government (Department of Labor) requires an independent audit to ensure the money is actually there. This is governed by a law called **ERISA**.

The **Compliance Audit Report** is the auditor's "Clean Bill of Health." It states that the company isn't "borrowing" from the pension fund and that all employees are getting the matches they were promised.

If a company is in financial trouble, they might "Edit" this report to hide a funding shortfall from their workers and the government. Verified hashes ensure the auditor's true findings match the federal filing.

## Data Verified

Plan sponsor name, plan year, audit opinion type (Unqualified/Qualified/Adverse), funding percentage, Enrolled Actuary (EA) name/license, Form 5500 filing date, material findings summary, date of audit completion.

**Document Types:**
- **ERISA Audit Report:** Mandatory for large plans (>100 participants).
- **Form 5500 Schedule SB/MB:** Signed by the Enrolled Actuary.
- **Summary Annual Report (SAR):** Proving the plan is healthy to participants.
- **Fiduciary Compliance Letter:** For trustee protection.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`milliman.com`, `mercer.com`) and current audit standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Verified** — Audit matches the firm's official record and peer-review.
- **Superseded** — Replaced by a corrected filing (e.g., due to data error).
- **In-Litigation** — Audit findings are being formally disputed by the sponsor.
- **Invalid** — Signatory not authorized or license inactive at time of audit.

## Second-Party Use

The **Plan Sponsor (Employer)** benefits from verification.

**DOL/IRS Audit Defense:** Proving to the Department of Labor (DOL) that the "Unqualified Opinion" on the 401(k) isn't a fake PDF created to hide a funding shortfall. A verified hash from a top actuarial firm provides instant "Zero-Fault" trust to federal auditors.

**Employee Trust:** Displaying the "Verified Healthy" status on the employee benefit portal to reassure workers that their retirement savings are being managed responsibly.

## Third-Party Use

**Department of Labor (EBSA)**
**Enforcement:** Regulators can verify the authenticity of Form 5500 attachments across millions of plans. OCR-to-hash prevents "Opinion Shopping" where a company hides a "Qualified" audit and submits a "Fake Unqualified" one.

**Investment Fiduciaries**
**Risk Monitoring:** Verifying the funding status of pension plans before making large-scale investment or acquisition decisions.

**Plan Participants (Employees)**
**Governance Transparency:** Ensuring that the annual "Healthy Plan" notice they receive in the mail is actually what the external auditor signed.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Funding Smoothing" Fraud Problem**

- **Percent Tampering:** Editing a "92% Funded" status to read "102% Funded" to avoid mandatory federal catch-up payments.
- **Opinion Editing:** Removing a "Significant Deficiency" footnote from the audit report before sending it to the DOL.
- **Actuary Impersonation:** Creating a fake audit report on the letterhead of a reputable firm using the license number of an actuary who didn't actually perform the work.

**Issuer Types**

**Actuarial Consulting Firms:** (Milliman, Mercer, WTW).
**Specialist CPA Firms:** (ERISA audit specialists).
**Department of Labor:** (Hosting the official filing hashes).

## Competition vs. Form 5500 Public Search (EFAST2)

| Feature | OCR-to-Hash | EFAST2 Search (DOL) | Scanned PDF |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Integrity** | **Binds the Text.** Protects the numbers. | **Data-Only.** Doesn't verify the actual paper doc. | **Zero.** Easily forged. |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Bound to the Auditor. | **Gov-Bound.** | **Visual.** |
| **Speed** | **Instant.** Scan the paper at the board meeting. | **Slow.** Requires finding the EIN and downloading 50MB PDFs. | **Instant.** |
| **Freshness** | **Real-time.** Shows if firm retracted opinion. | **Laggy.** Depends on annual filing cycles. | **Static.** |

**Why OCR wins here:** The "Audit Gap." Federal databases only know what was *filed*. If a company files a fake document, the database is wrong. OCR-to-hash links the verifier back to the **Auditor's Record**, ensuring the data matches the professional's actual findings, not just the company's filing.
