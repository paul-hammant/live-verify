## What is a Trademark Registration?

A **Trademark Registration** is the legal proof of brand ownership. It grants a company the exclusive right to use a name, logo, or slogan in a specific industry (e.g., "Nike" for shoes). These certificates are the primary weapons used to shut down counterfeits on platforms like Amazon or eBay.

Fraud is high-stakes in the digital economy. Scammers create "Phantom Registrations" by Photoshopping a real USPTO certificate to claim ownership of a famous brand name they don't own. They then use these fake papers to file "Takedown Requests" against legitimate competitors. Verified hashes bind the **Registration Number, Mark Name, and Owner Entity** to the national trademark office's domain (e.g., `uspto.gov` or `euipo.europa.eu`).

## Data Verified

Registration number, mark type (Word/Design/Combined), mark text (for word marks), design file hash (for logos), owner name, goods/services classification (Nice Classes), registration date, first use date, jurisdiction, renewal expiration date, current status.

**Document Types:**
- **Registration Certificate:** The formal "Gold Seal" proof of ownership.
- **Renewal Certificate:** Proof that the 10-year maintenance was paid.
- **Assignment Record:** (Linked hash) proving the mark was legally sold to a new owner.
- **Notice of Opposition:** Warning that the mark is under legal challenge.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`uspto.gov`, `euipo.europa.eu`, `wipo.int`) and the brand standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Registered / Active** — The mark is valid and protected by law.
- **Cancelled** — **CRITICAL:** The mark has been voided (e.g., due to non-use or legal loss).
- **Abandoned** — **ALERT:** The application was never finalized; no legal protection.
- **Expired** — **ALERT:** The owner failed to file a 10-year renewal.

## Second-Party Use

The **Brand Owner / IP Attorney** benefits from verification.

**Marketplace Enforcement:** When a counterfeit seller appears on Amazon, the brand owner provides the verified hash of their "Registration." Amazon's "Brand Registry" system can instantly see **"REGISTERED - ACME CORP"** on the official USPTO domain, allowing them to ban the scammer in minutes instead of waiting 5 days for manual document review.

**Licensing Integrity:** When selling a license to a foreign distributor, the owner provides the verified hash. The distributor can see the exact "Design Hash" and "Goods Classes" authorized, ensuring they are paying for a legitimate, protected asset.

## Third-Party Use

**E-commerce Trust Teams (Trust & Safety)**
**Anti-Phishing Vetting:** Automatically scanning the hashes provided in "IP Takedown Requests." Verified hashes ensure that the person filing the complaint actually owns the mark, stopping "IP Bullying" where scammers use fake papers to destroy competitors.

**Venture Capital Investors**
**IP Due Diligence:** Before investing $5M in a startup, the VC scans the company's verified trademark hashes. This ensures the "Acme" brand is actually owned by the startup and hasn't been "Abandoned" or sold to someone else.

**Customs & Border Protection (CBP)**
**Counterfeit Seizure:** Officers in a shipping port scan the logo on a crate of electronics. If the hash doesn't match the verified owner's record, they can seize the goods as counterfeit.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Phantom Brand" Fraud Problem**

- **Ownership Hijacking:** Editing a PDF to change the "Owner Name" from a big company to a scammer's shell company.
- **Class Padding:** Adding "Medical Devices" to a trademark that was only registered for "T-shirts."
- **Status Masking:** Presenting a "Cancelled" registration as if it were still "Active" to close a business sale.

**Issuer Types**

**National IP Offices (USPTO, UKIPO).**
**Regional Registries (EUIPO).**
**International Bodies (WIPO - Madrid Protocol).**

**Privacy Salt:** Low. Trademark records are public by law. However, individual attorney contact IDs should be salted to protect professional privacy.

## Rationale

Trademarks are the "Identity of Commerce." By turning static certificates into verifiable digital bridges, we protect the global brand economy from the multi-billion dollar cost of counterfeiting and ensures that "Ownership" is a cryptographic fact, not a Photoshop trick.
