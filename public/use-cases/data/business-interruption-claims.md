## What is a Business Interruption Claim?

If a restaurant burns down or a factory is hit by a hurricane, the owner doesn't just lose the building; they lose the **income** they would have made while closed.

**Business Interruption (BI)** insurance pays for that lost profit. Because calculating "what could have been" is hard, specialized **Forensic Accountants** are hired to audit the company's tax returns and sales data.

The result is an **Adjustment Summary**. Because these documents often trigger multimillion-dollar insurance payouts, they are high-value targets for "PDF alteration" by unscrupulous owners or brokers.

## Data Verified

Insured entity name, incident date, period of restoration (days), adjusted lost net income, adjusted continuing expenses, extra expenses authorized, total claim payout, forensic accounting firm name, Claim ID.

**Document Types:**
- **BI Adjustment Summary:** The final bill/payout calculation.
- **Forensic Accounting Report:** Detailed analysis of tax returns and receipts.
- **Proof of Loss:** Final signed release for payment.
- **Extra Expense Authorization:** Interim approval for urgent costs.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (the Insurance Carrier) and the claim status.

**Status Indications:**
- **Approved/Final** — Calculation is verified and payment authorized.
- **Supplemental** — This summary has been updated by a later adjustment.
- **In-Litigation** — Claim amount is being formally disputed.
- **Paid** — Funds have been transmitted to the insured.

## Second-Party Use

The **Business Owner** benefits from verification.

**SBA Loan Applications:** Proving to the Small Business Administration (SBA) that their insurance claim was adjusted at $199,500, which helps in calculating the correct amount for a low-interest disaster loan (preventing "Double Dipping" or "Under-funding").

**Lienholder Notice:** Proving to a landlord or equipment lessor that the insurance company is paying for "Continuing Expenses," ensuring the business isn't evicted while they wait for repairs to finish.

## Third-Party Use

**Lenders (Banks)**
**Cash Flow Analysis:** If a business is applying for a line of credit post-disaster, the bank needs to see verified proof of the insurance recovery amount to model the company's future liquidity.

**Tax Authorities (IRS)**
**Taxable Income Audit:** Business interruption payouts for "Lost Profits" are generally taxable. Verification ensures the business reports the same amount to the IRS that they received from the insurer.

**M&A Buyers**
**Due Diligence:** A buyer of a business that recently suffered a disaster needs to verify the "Insurance Recovery" claims to ensure there are no hidden liabilities or uncollected claims.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Disaster Profit" Fraud Problem**

- **Revenue Inflation:** Editing old tax returns or POS reports to make the "Lost Revenue" look higher than it was.
- **Fabricated Expenses:** Creating fake invoices for "Extra Equipment Rental" to get more cash from the insurer.
- **Report Forgery:** Shady adjusters/accountants creating fake "Adjustment Summaries" to trick lenders into thinking a massive insurance payout is coming.

**Issuer Types**

**Commercial Insurance Carriers:** (Liberty Mutual, Chubb, AIG, Travelers).
**Forensic Accounting Firms:** (Baker Tilly, Meaden & Moore).
**Independent Adjusting Firms.**

## Competition vs. Forensic Audits

| Feature | OCR-to-Hash | Manual Forensic Audit | Scanned PDF |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Bound to the Insurer. | **Credential-Bound.** Trust the CPA. | **Zero.** Easily forged. |
| **Speed** | **Instant.** Scan the summary. | **Slow.** Takes weeks/months to audit books. | **Instant.** |
| **Cost** | **Low.** Standard web infra. | **High.** CPA fees can be $500+/hour. | **None.** |
| **Integrity** | **Binds Result.** Proves the final number. | **Binds Process.** Verifies the data. | **Vulnerable.** |

**Why OCR wins here:** The "Post-Audit Gap." A forensic accountant spends 3 months auditing a business to arrive at a $199,500 figure. OCR-to-hash **protects that final result**. It ensures that the massive effort put into the audit isn't wasted by a fraudster changing a single digit in the final PDF before sending it to a bank or the government.
