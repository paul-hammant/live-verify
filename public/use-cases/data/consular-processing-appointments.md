## What is a Visa Interview Notice?

Getting a US Green Card requires a face-to-face interview at a US Embassy (like the one in Montreal or London).

The **Appointment Notice** is your "Admission Ticket." Security guards at the embassy perimeter will not even let you into the queue without this specific piece of paper.

Fraudsters often create fake notices to get people into high-security zones or to trick employers into thinking their visa is "in progress." OCR-to-hash allows guards to verify the **authenticity of the paper** at the gate, ensuring that only scheduled, verified applicants enter the secure zone.

## Data Verified

Applicant name, NVC/Consular Case Number, Appointment Date/Time, Consulate location (City/Country), Visa Category (e.g., CR-1, IR-1, EB-3), number of derivative applicants, date of issuance.

**Document Types:**
- **NVC Appointment Letter:** The standard notice sent to the applicant.
- **Biometric Appointment Notice:** For the off-site Fingerprint Center (VAC/ASC).
- **Medical Exam Authorization:** Linked to the appointment date.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`state.gov`) and current interview standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Scheduled** — Appointment is valid; security clearance granted.
- **Rescheduled** — This notice is void; a new date has been set.
- **Cancelled** — Interview revoked (e.g., due to document deficiency).
- **Completed** — Interview has already taken place for this notice.

## Second-Party Use

The **Visa Applicant** benefits from verification.

**Consulate Entry:** Proving to the security guards outside the embassy/consulate that the "Interview Notice" is legitimate. This prevents being turned away at the gate due to a suspected forgery or a typo in the mission's manual guard list.

**Travel Logistics:** Proving to airlines or border agents (if traveling to a third country for the interview) that the trip is for an official, verified government appointment.

**Employer Proof:** Proving to a current employer why they need to be absent for several days for international travel.

## Third-Party Use

**Consular Security / Local Guard Force**
**Access Control:** Embassies are high-target environments. Guards can instantly verify notices at the perimeter fence to ensure only legitimate applicants are allowed to queue, reducing the risk of protesters or attackers using fake letters.

**Visa Medical Clinics**
**Intake Integrity:** Authorized clinics can verify the "Interview Date" before performing the mandatory medical exam, ensuring the medical report won't expire before the actual interview takes place.

**Airlines (International)**
**Travel Authorization:** Verifying that a passenger traveling to a consulate city has a verified appointment, reducing the risk of "Refusal of Entry" at the destination.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Embassy Gate" Fraud Problem**

- **Fabricated Notices:** Scammers creating fake appointment letters to get people into high-security zones or to sell "fake spots" in the interview queue to desperate applicants.
- **Date Swapping:** Changing an old appointment date to "Today" to try and force an interview ahead of schedule.
- **Derivative Fraud:** Adding extra "Family Members" to a real appointment letter to smuggle people into the mission.

**Issuer Types**

**National Visa Center (NVC):** (Primary scheduler for immigrant visas).
**U.S. Embassies & Consulates:** (Post-level scheduling for non-immigrant visas).
**Third-Party Scheduling Vendors:** (e.g., USTravelDocs, AIS, CGI Federal).

**Privacy Salt:** Critical. Case numbers are unique and sensitive. The hash must be salted to prevent "Guess-and-Check" searches of the entire visa backlog.

## Competition vs. CEAC Status Search

| Feature | OCR-to-Hash | CEAC Search (Public) | Paper Notice |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Integrity** | **Binds Identity.** Proves *Who* is scheduled. | **General.** Often just says "Ready" or "At NVC." | **Low.** Easily faked. |
| **Speed** | **Instant.** Scan the paper at the gate. | **Slow.** Requires typing case # and solving difficult CAPTCHAs. | **Instant.** |
| **Trust** | **Cryptographic.** Bound to `state.gov`. | **High.** Direct DB access. | **Medium.** |
| **User Access** | **Restricted.** Only people with the paper can verify. | **Public.** Anyone with a case # can search. | **N/A.** |

**Why OCR wins here:** The "Perimeter" reality. Security guards standing in the rain outside a consulate don't have the time or tools to solve CAPTCHAs on the CEAC website for every person in line. OCR-to-hash turns the **Physical Appointment Letter** into a high-speed "Access Token" that provides definitive proof of scheduling in seconds.
