## What is a Census Receipt?

Every 10 years, the government counts every person in the country. Participating in the **Census** is mandatory by law in many countries.

A **Census Household Receipt** is your proof that you filled out the form. It confirms that "Household #9988 participated on April 1."

In some areas, you need this verified receipt to get local benefits, register for school, or to prove to a "knock-on-the-door" enumerator that you already completed your duty. OCR-to-hash allows you to prove you participated without having to reveal your private family data to a stranger at the door.

## Data Verified

Census year, household confirmation number, geographic area (Census Tract), household count, date of submission, enumerator ID (if applicable), completion status.

**Document Types:**
- **Census Household Receipt:** Printed or digital proof of participation.
- **Enumerator Badge:** For door-to-door officials.
- **Historical Census Extract:** Certified copy of a record from 72+ years ago.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`census.gov`) and the submission standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Verified** — Record exists and matches the national registry.
- **In-Progress** — Submission received but requires clarification.
- **Historical** — Record released to the National Archives (NARA).
- **Invalid** — Confirmation number not found.

## Second-Party Use

The **Resident / Head of Household** benefits from verification.

**Compliance Proof:** In jurisdictions where census participation is mandatory by law, the verified receipt proves the household has fulfilled its legal duty, preventing fines or repeat visits from enumerators.

**Address Verification:** Proving to a local school district or utility company that they were a resident at a specific address on "Census Day" using a verified government record.

## Third-Party Use

**The National Archives (NARA)**
**Data Preservation:** Ensuring that the digital archives of census data match the original physical submissions. OCR-to-hash creates a permanent link between the "Persistent Paper" and the "Digital Archive."

**Local School Districts**
**Planning:** Using verified household count aggregates to plan for future classroom and bus route requirements.

**Genealogists / Historians**
**Record Integrity:** Verifying that a scanned historical census record (e.g., from 1950) is an authentic, non-altered document from the government files.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Data Skew" Fraud Problem**

- **Participation Avoidance:** Creating a fake "Confirmation Receipt" to stop enumerators from knocking on the door.
- **Household Padding:** Altering a receipt to show *more* people in a household to qualify for higher local benefits or larger grants.
- **Enumerator Fraud:** A lazy enumerator fabricating household submissions to meet their daily quota.

**Issuer Types**

**National Statistical Agencies:** (e.g., U.S. Census Bureau, Statistics Canada).
**National Archives:** (Managing long-term historical data).

**Privacy Salt:** Critical. Census data is protected by strict privacy laws (e.g., Title 13 in the USA). The hash must be salted to ensure that a third party cannot "brute force" the names or addresses of residents.

## Competition vs. Direct Database (Title 13)

| Feature | OCR-to-Hash | Census Internal DB | Scanned Image (Ancestry) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Privacy** | **High.** Hash proves *participation* without revealing *PII*. | **Restricted.** Access prohibited by federal law for 72 years. | **Zero.** Everything is visible once the 72-year rule passes. |
| **Trust** | **Cryptographic.** Bound to `census.gov`. | **High.** Direct from the source. | **Medium.** Prone to digital "Cleanup" errors. |
| **Integrity** | **Binds Content.** Proves the *Count* hasn't changed. | **High.** | **Vulnerable.** |

**Why OCR wins here:** The "Participation Proof" without "Content Leakage." Citizens need to prove they participated without necessarily showing the government their income or family details to a third party (like a landlord). OCR-to-hash allows for a "Verified Participation" token that respects the constitutional privacy of the census.
