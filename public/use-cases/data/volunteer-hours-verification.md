## What is Volunteer Hour Verification?

Volunteer service is a "Reputation Currency." Students need verified hours for **University Applications**, employees need them for **Corporate Giving Matches**, and defendants need them to satisfy **Court-Ordered Community Service**.

The problem is that "Volunteer Certificates" are among the easiest documents to forge. A student might turn 10 hours into 100 hours with a pen, or a defendant might create a fake letterhead from a local food bank to avoid jail time. Verified hashes bind the **Total Hours, Project Scope, and Supervisor Identity** to the charity's domain (e.g., `redcross.org` or `habitat.org`).

## Data Verified

Volunteer name, organization name, EIN (Tax ID), project description, total hours, service date range, supervisor name/title, internal volunteer ID.

**Document Types:**
- **Certificate of Service:** The formal award/recognition.
- **Service Log:** Detailed list of individual shifts.
- **Community Service Letter:** For court or school requirements.
- **Corporate Matching Form:** To trigger employee donation matches.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`redcross.org`, `salvationarmy.org`) and the record standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Verified** — Hours match the organization's database snapshot.
- **Pending Audit** — Hours are recorded but not yet final-signed by a director.
- **Revoked** — **ALERT:** The record was deleted (e.g., due to reported behavior issues).
- **Unknown** — Hash not found; high risk of fabrication.

## Second-Party Use

The **Volunteer (Student/Employee)** benefits from verification.

**College Admissions:** A high school senior can provide the verified hash of their "120 Hours" to a university. The admissions officer can instantly see **"VERIFIED - RED CROSS"** from the official domain, giving the student a competitive edge over those with un-verifiable paper letters.

**Career Branding:** A professional can include a verified "Service Badge" on their LinkedIn profile or CV, proving their commitment to social responsibility with cryptographic certainty.

## Third-Party Use

**University Admissions Offices**
**Integrity Filter:** Thousands of students claim "100+ hours" of service. OCR-to-hash allows the university to instantly verify the truth, protecting the "Fairness" of the admissions process from fraudulent claims.

**Criminal Courts / Probation Officers**
**Mandate Verification:** Verifying that a defendant actually performed the 50 hours of community service required by their plea deal. Verification stops the common "Fake Letterhead" fraud used to bypass sentencing requirements.

**Corporate CSR Teams**
**Giving Match Audit:** Ensuring that "Volunteer Time Off" (VTO) or "Giving Matches" are only paid out for verified hours contributed to legitimate 501(c)(3) organizations.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Pencil Inflation" Fraud Problem**

- **Hour Padding:** Changing "10.0" to "100.0" on a PDF certificate.
- **Template Mimicry:** Using a famous charity's logo to vouch for service that never happened.
- **Legacy Forgery:** Creating a "2024" letter in 2026 to hide a gap in a resume or a missed court deadline.

**Issuer Types**

**National Charities.**
**Local Community Centers / Food Banks.**
**University Volunteer Portals (e.g., GivePulse).**

**Privacy Salt:** Low to Medium. While service is public, individual IDs and specific projects can be private. The hash should be salted to prevent "Volunteer Roster Scraping."

## Rationale

Volunteerism is the "Social Credit" of a healthy society. By turning service letters into verifiable digital bridges, we protect the value of honest labor and ensure that rewards go to those who actually do the work.
