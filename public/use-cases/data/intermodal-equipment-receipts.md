## Data Verified

Container ID, Chassis ID, Trucking company name, Driver ID (hash), Outgate/Ingate status, detailed damage codes (e.g., SC-1, DT-4), seal integrity status, terminal location ID, precise timestamp, issuing terminal operator.

**Document Types:**
- **Inbound EIR:** When a trucker brings a container *into* the port.
- **Outbound EIR:** When a trucker picks up a container *from* the port.
- **Street Turn Receipt:** When equipment is transferred between truckers outside the port.
- **Chassis Inspection Report:** Specifically for the road-worthiness of the trailer.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (the Terminal Operator or Port Authority) and current asset status.

**Status Indications:**
- **Outgated** — Equipment is currently in the possession of the trucker.
- **Returned/Ingated** — Equipment has been verified back at the terminal.
- **Damage Claim Active** — Terminal has flagged the asset for repair billing.
- **Lost/Stolen** — Asset reported missing from the fleet.

## Second-Party Use

The **Trucking Company / Driver** benefits from verification.

**Liability Defense:** Proving to the Steamship Line (e.g., Maersk) that the "12-inch scratch" was already noted on the verified EIR at the moment of pickup. Verification prevents the carrier from charging the trucker $500 for a repair they didn't cause.

**Billing Disputes:** Providing verified "Outgate vs Ingate" timestamps to a customer to justify "Demurrage" or "Detention" charges based on actual terminal data.

## Third-Party Use

**Ocean Carriers (Steamship Lines)**
**Maintenance Audit:** Instantly verifying the condition reports from 100+ different global terminals. OCR-to-hash allows the carrier to build a digital history of every asset's damage, identifying "Repeat Offender" truckers who consistently damage containers.

**Marine Insurers**
**Claim Adjudication:** Verifying the "Point of Damage." If a container is reported damaged at the warehouse, the insurer checks the verified EIR from the port. If the EIR was "Clean," the liability falls on the trucker.

**Chassis Pool Managers**
**Inventory Control:** Verifying the "Road-Worthiness" status of thousands of chassis moving across multiple port complexes.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Scratch and Dent" Fraud Problem**

- **Damage Erasure:** A trucker editing the PDF EIR to remove a "Dent" notation before returning the container, to avoid a $1,000 repair fee.
- **Timestamp Tampering:** Changing the "Outgate Time" to hide that a truck sat at the gate for 4 hours (which triggers a penalty for the terminal).
- **Identity Theft:** Using a "Clean" driver's ID on a paper EIR while an unauthorized or uninsured driver actually takes the load.

**Issuer Types**

**Terminal Operators:** (e.g., APM Terminals, DP World, SSA Marine).
**Port Authorities.**
**Intermodal Platforms:** (e.g., Advent eModal, IAS).

## Competition vs. EDI Messaging (322)

| Feature | OCR-to-Hash | EDI 322 (Gate Event) | Paper EIR |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **User Access** | **Universal.** Any driver or local shop. | **Restricted.** Requires complex B2B IT setup. | **Instant.** |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Bound to the Terminal. | **System-Bound.** | **Zero.** Easily forged. |
| **Integrity** | **Binds Damage Codes.** Protects the text. | **Data-Only.** | **Vulnerable.** |
| **Offline Proof** | **Strong.** The paper is the anchor. | **None.** Requires server access. | **Medium.** |

**Why OCR wins here:** The "Gate Moment." Terminals are high-pressure bottlenecks. When a driver disputes a damage code with a gate clerk, they are looking at a piece of paper or a handheld screen. They don't have access to the back-end EDI logs. OCR-to-hash turns the **Trucker's Receipt** into a live, trusted safety link that provides "Port-Grade" security in seconds.
