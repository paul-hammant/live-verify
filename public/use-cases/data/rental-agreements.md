## What is a Rental Agreement?

A **Rental Agreement** is the temporary contract of possession for a vehicle or piece of high-value equipment (e.g., an excavator or a professional camera). It defines the financial terms (daily rate), the insurance coverage (Loss Damage Waiver), and the "Return Condition."

This sector is plagued by high-volume, low-trust disputes. **Damage Fraud** is the primary issue: a rental company might "edit" a condition report to charge a customer for a scratch that was already there, or a customer might "edit" an agreement to show they paid for "Full Coverage" when they actually declined it. Verified hashes bind the **Odometer Reading, Fuel Level, and Coverage Selections** to the rental company's domain (e.g., `hertz.com` or `unitedrentals.com`).

## Data Verified

Rental Agreement (RA) number, renter name, vehicle VIN/Plate, unit number, pickup location/time, return location/time, starting odometer, fuel/charge level, accepted coverage options (LDW, PAI, SLI), daily rate, mileage limits, deposit amount, date of issuance.

**Document Types:**
- **Rental Record:** The primary contract given at the counter.
- **Pre-Rental Condition Report:** Showing existing scratches/dents.
- **Final Return Receipt:** (Linked hash) showing actual charges.
- **Accident Report Supplement:** Proof of damage reporting.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`hertz.com`, `enterprise.com`, `turo.com`) and the rental standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Rental Active** — Vehicle is currently in the renter's possession.
- **Closed / Settled** — Vehicle returned and final payment cleared.
- **Damage Reported** — **ALERT:** A post-rental damage claim is active for this unit.
- **Overdue** — **CRITICAL:** Vehicle has not been returned by the contracted date.

## Second-Party Use

The **Renter (Customer)** benefits from verification.

**Damage Claim Defense:** If a rental company sends a $2,000 bill for a "dent" 3 weeks after the rental, the customer can scan the verified hash of their "Pre-Rental Condition Report." If the hash returns **"VERIFIED - DENT RECORDED AT PICKUP,"** the customer has the cryptographic proof needed to stop the fraudulent claim instantly.

**Expense Reimbursement:** A business traveler can provide the verified hash of their "Final Receipt" to their employer. "Verified by Hertz" ensures the finance department that the "Fuel Service Charge" or "Upgrade Fee" was an actual corporate cost and not a manual edit to the PDF.

## Third-Party Use

**Credit Card Insurers (Secondary Coverage)**
**Claims Adjudication:** Many premium cards provide rental insurance. Before paying a claim, the card insurer scans the verified RA hash. Verification ensures that the renter didn't "edit" the RA to hide that they *accepted* the rental company's own LDW (which would void the credit card's secondary benefit).

**Corporate Travel Managers**
**Compliance Auditing:** Automatically scanning thousands of employee rental hashes. If an employee's verified RA shows they selected a "Luxury SUV" when the company policy only allows "Intermediate," the system flags the violation instantly.

**Law Enforcement**
**Stolen Vehicle Recovery:** During a traffic stop, an officer can scan the "Rental App" or paper RA. Verified hashes eliminate the risk of "Fake Rental" papers used by criminals to drive stolen vehicles across state lines.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Scratch & Pay" Fraud Problem**

- **Odometer Padding:** Editing a return receipt to hide 500 "Over-Limit" miles.
- **Coverage Masking:** Changing a "DECLINED" insurance choice to "ACCEPTED" after a crash.
- **Lien Ghosting:** Creating a fake "Paid in Full" receipt to hide a $500 unpaid cleaning fee.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**National Rental Chains.**
**Peer-to-Peer Platforms (Turo, Getaround).**
**Construction Equipment Rental Yards.**

**Privacy Salt:** Essential. Renter names and locations are sensitive travel data. The hash must be salted to prevent "Customer Tracking" by data brokers.

## Rationale

Rental documentation is the "History of Condition." By turning agreements into verifiable digital bridges, we protect the consumer's wallet and the company's fleet, ensuring that "Responsibility for the Asset" is backed by cryptographic proof.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing

A jurisdiction may require the issuer to retain a **witnessing firm** for regulatory compliance. The witnessing firm:

- Receives all hashes from the issuer, and any subsequent changes to the payload as they happen—which may manifest as a new hash, a status change, or even a 404 (record deleted)
- Receives structured content/metadata (key identifiers and dates)
- Does **NOT** receive plaintext or sensitive personal information
- Provides an immutable, timestamped audit trail—available to the jurisdiction on demand, to document holders/third parties during disputes, or as expert witness testimony in legal proceedings

This provides:
- **Non-repudiation:** Issuer cannot deny issuing the document
- **Timestamp proof:** Document existed at a specific time
- **Regulatory audit:** Jurisdictions can inspect the witness ledger for fraud detection
- **Resilience:** Verification works even if issuer's systems go down

**Public Blockchain (Non-Party)**

Witnessing firms may periodically commit rollups to an inexpensive public blockchain, providing an ultimate immutability guarantee. The blockchain is a "non-party"—infrastructure, not a participant in the transaction. This creates multiple verification paths:

1. **Issuer domain** — Direct check against the issuer
2. **Witnessing firm** — Independent confirmation with timestamp
3. **Public blockchain** — Decentralized trust anchor via rollup inclusion
