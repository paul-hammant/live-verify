## Data Verified

Applicant name, USCIS Receipt Number, Appointment Date/Time, Field Office location, Form Type (e.g., I-485, N-400), Case Category, date of notice issuance, security access code.

**Document Types:**
- **I-797C Interview Notice:** The primary legal appointment letter.
- **Naturalization Oath Ceremony Notice:** (Form N-445).
- **Request for Evidence (RFE):** (Linked hash) proving a pending case.
- **Field Office Entry Badge:** (Digital) for building security.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`uscis.gov`) and current appointment standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Scheduled** — Appointment is active; entrance authorized.
- **Rescheduled** — This notice is void; a new date has been issued.
- **Completed** — Interview has already taken place for this notice.
- **Cancelled** — Interview revoked (e.g., due to case denial or closure).

## Second-Party Use

The **Applicant (Petitioner)** benefits from verification.

**Building Entrance:** Proving to the federal guards at the USCIS Field Office that the paper notice is legitimate. This prevents being turned away at the door due to a "Suspected Fake" letter or a name typo on the guard's manual list.

**Travel / Time-Off:** Proving to an employer or school why they must be absent for an official federal hearing. A verified hash from `uscis.gov` is more authoritative than a plain printout.

## Third-Party Use

**Federal Protective Service (FPS) / Guards**
**Access Control:** Field offices are high-security environments. Guards can instantly verify notices at the metal detector to ensure only authorized applicants are allowed into the restricted waiting rooms, stopping "Line Jumpers" with fake letters.

**Immigration Attorneys**
**Case Monitoring:** Instantly verifying the "Status" of a client's interview schedule. If a client provides a "Rescheduled" notice, the attorney can verify the new date against the hash to update their calendar.

**Local Law Enforcement**
**Identity Proof:** If an immigrant is stopped by police while in "Pending Status," a verified interview notice proves they are actively following the legal process for a Green Card or Citizenship.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Fake Notice" Fraud Problem**

- **Fabricated Notices:** Scammers creating fake USCIS letters to trick employers into thinking an illegal worker's case is "Processing" or to sell "Entry Spots" to people trying to get inside federal buildings.
- **Date Alteration:** Changing a 2024 date to 2026 to try and force a walk-in interview.
- **Impersonation:** Using a family member's notice by editing the name on the PDF.

**Issuer Types**

**U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS).**
**Department of Homeland Security (DHS).**
**Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR):** (For court hearings).

**Privacy Salt:** Critical. Case numbers and names are highly sensitive PII. The hash must be salted to prevent "Guess-and-Check" searches of the entire immigration backlog.

## Competition vs. USCIS Case Status Online

| Feature | OCR-to-Hash | Case Status Online (Web) | Paper Notice |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Integrity** | **Binds Identity.** Proves *Who* is scheduled. | **General.** Often just says "Interview Scheduled." | **Low.** Easily faked. |
| **Speed** | **Instant.** 5-second scan at the door. | **Slow.** Requires typing 13-char receipt # and solving CAPTCHAs. | **Instant.** |
| **Field Access** | **High.** Built for security guards. | **Low.** Gov websites are hard to use on handheld devices. | **Universal.** |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Bound to `uscis.gov`. | **High.** Direct DB access. | **Medium.** |

**Why OCR wins here:** The "Front Door" reality. Security guards standing at a metal detector have 10 seconds to vet a person. They cannot type 13-character receipt numbers into a website for every visitor. OCR-to-hash turns the **Physical Appointment Letter** into a high-speed "Security Badge," ensuring safety and efficiency at federal facilities.
