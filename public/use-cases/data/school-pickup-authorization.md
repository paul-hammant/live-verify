## What is a Pickup Authorization?

Every school day, millions of children are released to adults who aren't their parents — grandparents, nannies, aunts, family friends, carpool parents. For school staff, this creates a daily high-stakes verification problem: **release to the wrong person and a child could be harmed or abducted.**

Schools maintain "authorized pickup lists" — but these are often paper binders, outdated spreadsheets, or closed-ecosystem apps. When Grandma shows up and the front desk doesn't recognize her, the 30-second interaction becomes tense for everyone.

A **Pickup Authorization** is a verifiable document proving: "Parent X has authorized Person Y to pick up Child Z from this school until Date D."

## Data Verified

Authorized person's name, photo (hash), relationship to child, child's name/grade, designating parent's name, authorization date, expiration date, any restrictions (e.g., "Fridays only," "after 3pm only"), school-issued authorization ID.

**Document Types:**
- **Standing Authorization:** Valid for the school year (grandparents, regular caregivers).
- **Temporary Authorization:** Single-day or short-term (neighbor helping during parent travel).
- **Emergency Contact Upgrade:** Elevating an emergency contact to pickup-authorized.
- **Restricted Authorization:** Court-ordered limitations (e.g., "supervised pickup only").

## Verification Response

The endpoint returns a simple status code:

- **OK** — Person is currently authorized to pick up the named child
- **EXPIRED** — Authorization has lapsed; contact the designating parent
- **REVOKED** — Authorization was explicitly cancelled; do not release
- **RESTRICTED** — Authorization has conditions; see details (e.g., "Fridays only")
- **404** — Authorization not found (forged document, wrong school, or OCR error)

The issuer domain is visible from the `verify:` line on the document itself (e.g., `lincoln-elementary.edu`).

## Second-Party Use

The **Authorized Pickup Person** (second party) receives the authorization credential from the school (first party), **keeps it**, and presents it when picking up.

**Confidence at the Door:** Grandma doesn't have to argue with skeptical staff or wait while they flip through binders. She presents the credential, staff verifies, child is released.

**Multiple Schools:** A grandparent authorized at three grandchildren's schools carries three credentials — each verified against the respective school's domain.

**Proof of Legitimacy:** If challenged by another parent or bystander ("Who are you taking that child?"), the authorized person has verifiable proof of their status.

## Third-Party Use

**School Front Desk Staff**
The primary use case. Staff member sees unfamiliar adult claiming authorization. Instead of calling the parent (who may be in a meeting), flipping through paper lists (outdated), or trusting a verbal claim (dangerous), they verify the credential in seconds.

**After-School Programs / Day Camps**
Programs operating on school grounds or receiving children from schools need the same authorization chain. A credential issued by the school extends to affiliated programs.

**Carpool Coordinators**
Parent-organized carpools where multiple adults pick up each other's children. Each driver carries credentials for all children they're authorized to transport.

## The High-Conflict Divorce Scenario

The most dangerous pickup moments occur in custody disputes:

- **Non-custodial parent** shows up during the other parent's custody time
- **Estranged relative** (grandparent cut off after family conflict) attempts pickup
- **Abduction risk** — one parent fears the other will take the child and flee

In these cases, the custody order (see [Adoption Papers and Custody Orders](view.html?doc=adoption-custody-orders)) defines who has legal authority. The school's pickup authorization **must align** with the custody order — but it's a separate operational document.

**Critical integration:**
- Schools should require custody documentation before issuing pickup authorizations
- `RESTRICTED` status can flag court-ordered limitations ("Father may pick up only on designated weekends per Cook County Case 2025-D-092341")
- Changes to custody orders should trigger immediate review of pickup authorizations

## Scope and Limitations

**Where OCR-to-hash fits:**
- **Paper-based schools** without digital systems — rural areas, developing countries, under-resourced districts
- **Cross-system portability** — credential works even if the verifier doesn't have the school's app
- **Archival/dispute resolution** — proving after the fact that authorization existed on a specific date
- **Backup verification** — when the school's app is down or the pickup person's phone is dead

**Where app-based solutions are often better:**

Many schools already use pickup management apps (Pikmykid, SchoolPass, Brightwheel, etc.) that provide:

- **Real-time parent control** — Parent can authorize a neighbor for today's pickup in 30 seconds from their phone
- **QR code at pickup** — Authorized person shows QR on their phone; staff scans; photo and authorization appear instantly
- **Geofencing** — App notifies school when authorized person is approaching
- **Photo matching** — Staff sees the mugshot on their tablet, matches to person in front of them
- **Instant revocation** — Parent can cancel authorization while the person is en route

**Honest assessment:** For schools with functioning digital infrastructure, a well-implemented app with QR codes is often faster and safer than OCR-to-hash. The QR workflow is:

1. Authorized person opens app, shows QR
2. Staff scans QR
3. Photo + authorization details appear on staff tablet
4. Visual match → release child

This is faster than text selection and provides the critical photo-matching step in-line.

**OCR-to-hash value proposition:**
- Schools that can't or won't adopt apps
- Interoperability across districts/systems
- Offline-capable verification
- Audit trail that doesn't depend on a vendor's database

## Verification Architecture

**The "Wrong Adult" Problem**

- **Outdated lists:** Paper binder says Grandma is authorized, but Parent revoked that two months ago after a family dispute.
- **Custody violations:** Non-custodial parent shows up on the wrong day, claims they're authorized.
- **Identity confusion:** "I'm the nanny" — but is this the current nanny or the one who was fired last month?
- **Social engineering:** Adult claims emergency ("Mom was in an accident, she sent me") to extract child.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**Schools / Districts** — The school is the trust anchor. Parents designate; schools issue.

**Why not parent-issued?** Parents don't have well-known domains. A credential from `jenniferchen.com` means nothing to school staff. The school acts as trusted intermediary — it knows the parent, verifies the designation, and issues against its own domain.

**Privacy Salt:** Critical. Child names + school names are highly sensitive. Hash must be salted to prevent enumeration attacks ("Which children attend Lincoln Elementary?").

## Jurisdictional Witnessing

A jurisdiction may require the issuer to retain a **witnessing firm** for regulatory compliance. The witnessing firm:

- Receives all hashes from the issuer, and any subsequent changes to the payload as they happen—which may manifest as a new hash, a status change, or even a 404 (record deleted)
- Receives structured content/metadata (key identifiers and dates)
- Does **NOT** receive plaintext or sensitive personal information
- Provides an immutable, timestamped audit trail—available to the jurisdiction on demand, to document holders/third parties during disputes, or as expert witness testimony in legal proceedings

This provides:
- **Non-repudiation:** School cannot deny issuing the authorization
- **Timestamp proof:** Authorization existed at a specific time
- **Regulatory audit:** Child welfare authorities can inspect the witness ledger
- **Resilience:** Verification works even if school's systems go down

**Public Blockchain (Non-Party)**

Witnessing firms may periodically commit rollups to an inexpensive public blockchain, providing an ultimate immutability guarantee. The blockchain is a "non-party"—infrastructure, not a participant in the transaction. This creates multiple verification paths:

1. **School domain** — Direct check against the issuer
2. **Witnessing firm** — Independent confirmation with timestamp
3. **Public blockchain** — Decentralized trust anchor via rollup inclusion

## Competition vs. Existing Solutions

| Feature | OCR-to-Hash | School Pickup App (QR) | Paper Binder | Phone Call to Parent |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Speed** | Medium (text selection) | **Fast** (scan QR, see photo) | Slow (flip pages) | Very slow (parent may not answer) |
| **Photo Matching** | Separate step | **Inline** (photo appears on scan) | Manual lookup | N/A |
| **Real-time Revocation** | Yes | **Yes** | No (until binder updated) | N/A |
| **Works Offline** | Yes (if cached) | Depends on app | Yes | No |
| **Cross-System** | **Yes** (any school's domain) | No (app-specific) | N/A | N/A |
| **Parent Friction** | Medium (school issues) | **Low** (self-service app) | High (paper forms) | N/A |

**Why QR often wins here:** The pickup moment is fast-paced and high-volume (50+ kids in 15 minutes at dismissal). QR scan → photo → release is the optimal UX. OCR-to-hash is a fallback for schools without apps, or for edge cases where app-based verification fails.
