## Data Verified

Agency name, IATA Numeric Code (8-digit), ASTA membership number, physical address, accreditation status (Full/GoLite/GoStandard), financial security status (e.g., Bonded/Verified Assets), authorized signatory, effective/expiration dates.

**Document Types:**
- **IATA Accreditation Certificate:** The high-trust "Wall License."
- **Agency Status Form:** Proving current financial health to airlines.
- **BSP (Billing & Settlement Plan) Summary:** Verified commission report.
- **ASTA Membership Seal:** Proving professional ethical standards.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`iata.org`, `asta.org`) and current agency standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Active** — Agency is fully authorized to issue tickets and collect commissions.
- **Suspended** — **ALERT:** Default on payments or safety violation found.
- **Terminated** — Accreditation revoked; no ticketing authority.
- **Expired** — Annual financial review or fee overdue.

## Second-Party Use

The **Travel Agency Owner** benefits from verification.

**Airline Negotiations:** Proving to a new airline partner (e.g., Emirates or Singapore Air) that their "IATA 8-digit Code" is verified and in good standing. This allows for immediate "Ticketing Authority" setup without waiting for weeks of manual paperwork.

**Customer Trust:** Posting the verified IATA/ASTA badge on the agency's website. High-end corporate clients won't book multi-million dollar travel contracts without seeing verified proof of professional standing.

## Third-Party Use

**Airlines / Carriers**
**Agency Vetting:** Instantly verifying the "Financial Health" of an agency before allowing them into the Billing & Settlement Plan (BSP). Verification prevents "Ghost Agencies" from issuing millions in tickets and defaulting on payments.

**Travel Tech Platforms (Saber / Amadeus)**
**GDS Onboarding:** Automatically verifying the IATA credentials of a new agency before granting access to the Global Distribution System (GDS).

**Consumer Protection Agencies**
**Fraud Detection:** Verifying that a "Discount Travel" website is actually a member of ASTA, protecting consumers from "Vapor-Vacation" scams.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Ghost Agency" Fraud Problem**

- **Code Borrowing:** An un-accredited sub-agent using a larger agency's IATA number illegally. Verification of the *Address/Name Hash* prevents this.
- **Status Falsification:** Editing a "Suspended" notice to read "Active" to trick an airline into extending credit.
- **Fabricated Certificates:** Using a realistic-looking template to create a fake "IATA Accredited" certificate for a phishing website.

**Issuer Types**

**International Air Transport Association (IATA):** (The primary global authority).
**American Society of Travel Advisors (ASTA).**
**National Travel Associations:** (e.g., ABTA in the UK).

## Competition vs. IATA Check-a-Code

| Feature | OCR-to-Hash | IATA Check-a-Code (Web) | Scanned PDF |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Bound to IATA. | **Database.** Direct from source. | **Zero.** Easily forged. |
| **Speed** | **Instant.** 5-second scan. | **Slow.** Requires typing 8 digits and solving CAPTCHAs. | **Instant.** |
| **Integrity** | **Binds Details.** Protects the Financial Tier. | **Data-Only.** Doesn't verify the paper. | **Vulnerable.** |
| **User Access** | **Universal.** Any airline/buyer can verify. | **Public.** But often limited to 1 query at a time. | **Universal.** |

**Why OCR wins here:** The "Agency Handoff." Travel agents work via PDFs and paper certificates when talking to airlines and hotels. OCR-to-hash turns the **Physical Credential** into a live, high-speed digital dashboard, providing the same level of trust as a manual IATA database search in a fraction of the time.
