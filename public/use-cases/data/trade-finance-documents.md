## What are Trade Finance Bills of Lading?

In the world of international banking, the **Negotiable Bill of Lading (B/L)** is more than just a receipt—it is a **Financial Collateral**. When a bank issues a **Letter of Credit (L/C)**, they often become the legal "Owner" of the cargo while it is on the water. The B/L is the "Title Deed" they hold until the buyer pays back the loan.

These documents are the primary target for **Trade Finance Fraud**. Scammers use "Ghost B/Ls" to get banks to pay for cargo that doesn't exist, or they "Double-Finance" the same shipment at two different banks. Verified hashes bind the **Consignee (Bank Name), Cargo Value, and On-Board Date** to the shipping line's or the port's domain (e.g., `msc.com` or `hapag-lloyd.com`).

## Data Verified

B/L number, carrier name, shipper name, consignee name (The Bank), notify party, vessel name, IMO number, on-board date, port of loading, description of goods (HS Code), total package count, weight/volume, freight status (Prepaid/Collect), date of issuance.

**Document Types:**
- **Negotiable B/L:** The primary bank collateral.
- **Switch B/L:** Proof of mid-transit change of parties.
- **Claused B/L:** (Linked hash) documenting damaged cargo at loading.
- **Forwarder's Cargo Receipt (FCR):** Pre-loading proof for the bank.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`msc.com`, `maersk.com`, `hapag-lloyd.com`) and the title standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Verified / Negotiable** — The B/L is authentic and the bank currently holds title.
- **Accomplished / Delivered** — **ALERT:** Cargo was already released; this B/L is now empty paper.
- **Amended** — **ALERT:** The "On-Board Date" or "Quantity" was corrected after issuance.
- **Duplicate Financing Flag** — **CRITICAL:** This B/L number has been scanned by multiple banks.

## Second-Party Use

The **Trade Finance Bank (Lender)** benefits from verification.

**Collateral Liquidity:** Before releasing a $1M payment under a "Letter of Credit," the bank's trade desk scans the B/L provided by the exporter. "Verified by MSC" ensures that the cargo was actually loaded on the date claimed, removing the 48-hour "Discrepancy Check" delay and ensuring the bank's collateral is real.

**Risk Monitoring:** A bank can maintain a verified digital vault of all B/Ls they finance. If a vessel is involved in a collision (e.g., the Evergreen Suez event), the bank can instantly identify which of their verified B/Ls are on that ship and adjust their risk reserves in minutes.

## Third-Party Use

**Importing Buyers (The Customer)**
**Title Vetting:** Before paying the bank to release the B/L, the importer scans the hash. This ensures that the "On-Board" date matches their seasonal sales window and hasn't been "Back-Dated" by a supplier trying to avoid late penalties.

**Customs & Port Authorities**
**Manifest Audit:** Verifying that the cargo description on the physical B/L matches the carrier's digital filing (AMS/ENS), preventing "Tariff Evasion" where high-value goods are described as low-value components.

**Marine Insurance Underwriters**
**Loss Adjustment:** In a "General Average" claim, the insurer verifies the original B/L hash to determine the exact value and owner of the cargo being contributed.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Paper Ghost" Fraud Problem**

- **Double-Financing:** Taking the 3 "Original" B/Ls and pledging them to 3 different banks for 3 different loans.
- **Date Back-Dating:** Persuading a clerk to date a 15 MAR shipment as 10 MAR to meet an L/C deadline.
- **Phantom Cargo:** Creating a fake B/L for a container filled with "Painted Rocks" or "Empty Boxes" to steal a bank's payment.

**Issuer Types**

**Global Shipping Lines (Vessel Operators).**
**Digital Trade Platforms (e.g., TradeLens, Bolero).**
**Port Community Systems.**

**Privacy Salt:** Highly Critical. Individual trade routes and pricing are highly sensitive "National Interest" and business data. The hash must be salted and access restricted to authorized Swift/Banking IPs.

## Rationale

Trade finance is the "Credit Engine of the Planet." By turning B/Ls into verifiable digital bridges, we protect the banking system from multi-billion dollar fraud and ensure that the "Goods on the Water" are a cryptographic fact, not a paper fabrication.

## What is a Certificate of Origin (C/O)?

In global trade, the **Certificate of Origin (C/O)** is the "Nationality Passport" for a shipment. It is an official document from a Chamber of Commerce or a Ministry of Trade declaring exactly where the goods were manufactured. This document determines the **Import Duty** (tax)—which can range from 0% (under a Free Trade Agreement) to 100% (under Anti-Dumping rules).

These papers are the primary tools for **Tariff Evasion**. Fraud is high-stakes: exporters often "edit" a C/O to change the origin from a high-tax country (e.g., China) to a low-tax one (e.g., Vietnam) to save millions in duties. This is known as "Transshipment" or "Origin Laundering." Verified hashes bind the **Exporter Name, Goods Description, and Country of Origin** to the issuing Chamber's domain (e.g., `londonchamber.com` or `vietnamchamber.gov`).

## Data Verified

Certificate number, Chamber of Commerce name, exporter name, consignee name, country of origin, HS Code (Harmonized System), detailed goods description, weight/volume, invoice reference, issue date, Chamber official ID.

**Document Types:**
- **Non-Preferential C/O:** Standard proof of origin.
- **Preferential C/O (EUR.1 / GSP):** Proof needed for 0% duty.
- **Form A:** For Generalized System of Preferences.
- **Manufacturer's Declaration:** (Linked hash) the primary proof for the Chamber.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`londonchamber.com`, `iccwbo.org`, `commerce.gov.vn`) and the document standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Verified / Authentic** — The certificate is on file and the origin is confirmed.
- **Revoked** — **CRITICAL:** The Chamber has withdrawn the C/O (e.g., due to discovered fraud).
- **In Dispute** — **ALERT:** The origin is under investigation by customs.
- **Expired** — **ALERT:** The document has passed its 1-year usage limit.

## Second-Party Use

The **Exporter (Seller)** benefits from verification.

**Customs Clearance Speed:** When exporting a $1M shipment, the exporter provides the verified hash of the C/O. The destination customs officer can instantly see **"VERIFIED ORIGIN - UK"** on their screen, bypassing the 5-day "Manual Document Authentication" delay and getting the goods to the customer faster.

**Letter of Credit (L/C) Payout:** Banks only pay an exporter if the C/O is perfect. Verified hashes eliminate the "Discrepancy" risk where a bank rejects a C/O because of a typo or un-clear stamp, ensuring the exporter gets paid on time.

## Third-Party Use

**Customs & Border Protection (CBP)**
**Anti-Dumping Vetting:** Before granting a 0% duty rate, the officer scans the C/O hash. Verification ensures the "Made in Vietnam" claim isn't just a "Photoshopped Sticker" covering for "Made in China" steel or electronics, protecting the domestic market.

**Commercial Banks (Trade Desk)**
**Compliance Audit:** Verifying that the origin stated on the C/O matches the "Shipment Route" on the Bill of Lading, stopping "Illegal Transshipment" fraud that could lead to bank sanctions.

**Importing Buyers**
**ESG / Forced Labor Audit:** Verifying the exact factory and region of origin to ensure compliance with the "Uighur Forced Labor Prevention Act" (UFLPA) or other ethical sourcing laws.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Origin Laundering" Fraud Problem**

- **Nationality Swapping:** Changing the country from "Russia" (Sanctioned) to "Kazakhstan" (Non-Sanctioned) on a PDF.
- **Stamp Forgery:** Using a high-end digital rubber stamp to create a fake Chamber certification.
- **HS Code Masking:** Describing "Furniture" as "Lumber" to take advantage of a specific trade treaty.

**Issuer Types**

**National Chambers of Commerce.**
**International Chamber of Commerce (ICC - World Chambers Federation).**
**National Ministries of Trade.**

**Privacy Salt:** Essential. Trade routes and specific exporter-buyer pairs are highly sensitive business data. The hash must be salted to prevent "Supply Chain Mapping" by competitors.

## Rationale

Certificates of origin are the "Diplomatic Documents" of trade. By turning static stamps into verifiable digital bridges, we protect the billions of dollars in duty revenue and ensure that "Global Sourcing" is backed by the digital truth of the Chamber, not the creative editing of a smuggler.

## What is a Trade Finance Invoice?

In global commerce, the **Commercial Invoice** is the ultimate bill. It defines the value of the goods, the currency of payment, and the **Incoterms** (who pays for shipping/insurance). For a bank or a customs officer, this document is the "Proof of Value."

This document is the primary engine for **Trade-Based Money Laundering (TBML)** and **Tax Evasion**. Scammers use "Under-Invoicing" (editing a $1M invoice to show $100k) to evade import duties, or "Over-Invoicing" (editing a $10k invoice to show $1M) to illegally move large sums of cash across borders. Verified hashes bind the **Total Value, Unit Prices, and Buyer/Seller IDs** to the exporter's or the platform's domain (e.g., `samsung.com` or `tradelens.com`).

## Data Verified

Invoice number, exporter name/VAT ID, importer name, invoice date, itemized list of goods, HS Codes (Harmonized System), unit quantities, unit prices, total invoice value, currency (e.g., USD/EUR), Incoterms (e.g., FOB/CIF), payment terms, bank account ID.

**Document Types:**
- **Commercial Invoice:** The primary bill for customs/payment.
- **Pro-Forma Invoice:** A preliminary bill for financing.
- **Consular Invoice:** (Linked hash) certified by an embassy.
- **Credit Note:** Proof of value reduction for damaged goods.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`samsung.com`, `zara.com`, `tradelens.com`) and the billing standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Active / Verified** — Invoice matches the exporter's official accounts receivable.
- **Paid / Settled** — **ALERT:** The invoice has already been paid (prevents double-financing).
- **Price Mismatch** — **CRITICAL:** The value on the paper was altered from the digital truth.
- **Cancelled** — **ALERT:** The transaction was voided; this paper is worthless.

## Second-Party Use

The **Exporter (Seller)** benefits from verification.

**Bank Financing Speed:** When selling a $1M invoice to a bank (Factoring), the exporter provides the verified hash. The bank can instantly see **"VERIFIED VALUE: $1M"** on their phone, removing the 3-day "Buyer Verification" call and getting the exporter their cash today.

**Customs Defense:** If a customs officer suspects "Under-Invoicing," the exporter can show the verified "Current" hash. This proves the price on the paper is the *exact* price recorded in their audited global accounting system, stopping a costly seizure.

## Third-Party Use

**Customs & Border Protection (CBP)**
**Valuation Vetting:** Officers scan the invoice hash at the port. Verification ensures the importer hasn't "Shrunk" the value to evade 25% import tariffs, protecting the national tax revenue.

**Trade Finance Banks**
**TBML Prevention:** Banks can't manually check the market price of every item. OCR-to-hash allows their system to bulk-verify that thousands of invoices match the digital records of reputable exporters, stopping "Over-Invoicing" scams used to move criminal cash.

**Tax Authorities (VAT / GST)**
**Refund Audit:** Verifying that a company's "Input Tax Credit" claims are backed by authentic, verified invoices from legitimate suppliers.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Price Pivot" Fraud Problem**

- **Under-Invoicing:** Editing a $100,000 PDF to read $10,000 to save $22,500 in import duties.
- **Over-Invoicing:** Editing a $10,000 PDF to read $100,000 to "justify" a large outgoing wire to a shell company abroad.
- **Duplicate Financing:** Presenting the same physical invoice to three different banks for three different loans.

**Issuer Types**

**Global Corporate ERPs (SAP, Oracle).**
**EDI Hubs (e.g., OpenText, GXS).**
**Government e-Invoicing Portals (e.g., in Brazil or Italy).**

**Privacy Salt:** Highly Critical. Invoice pricing and buyer lists are sensitive business secrets. The hash must be salted and access restricted to authorized customs and banking IPs.

## Rationale

The commercial invoice is the "DNA of Global Wealth." By turning static bills into verifiable digital bridges, we protect the global tax base and the banking system from the multi-billion dollar cost of trade-based fraud.
