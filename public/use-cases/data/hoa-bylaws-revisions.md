## Data Verified

HOA legal name, community name, specific Article/Section number being revised, exact text of the revision, date of board approval, date of adoption, revision version ID, Secretary's name, jurisdiction of recording.

**Document Types:**
- **Amended & Restated Bylaws:** The full governing document.
- **Notice of Rule Change:** 1-page flyer for the lobby/elevators.
- **CC&R Extract:** Covenants, Conditions & Restrictions.
- **Board Meeting Minutes:** (Linked hash) proving the legal vote.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`skylinetowers-hoa.com`, `associa.com`) and current rule status.

**Status Indications:**
- **Active/Final** — Rule is currently in effect and legally binding.
- **Superseded** — A newer version of this rule has been adopted.
- **Rescinded** — The rule has been cancelled by the Board.
- **Under Challenge** — Rule status disputed in court or by homeowners.

## Second-Party Use

The **Homeowner (Member)** benefits from verification.

**Compliance Defense:** If a homeowner is fined $500 for "Short-term Rental," they can verify the exact rule text on the date of the alleged violation. OCR-to-hash prevents a Board from "Silently Editing" the bylaws to increase fines or add restrictions after a dispute has already started.

**Resale Due Diligence:** Proving to a potential buyer that the "Pet Policy" or "Parking Rules" they are seeing in the sales packet are the **Verified Current Versions** from the Association.

## Third-Party Use

**Real Estate Attorneys / Title Companies**
**Closing Integrity:** Ensuring that the Bylaws provided during a property sale are authentic and include all verified amendments. Title companies need to ensure the buyer has received the correct, non-altered version of the CC&Rs.

**Commercial Lenders**
**Risk Management:** Verifying the "Rental Restrictions" in a condo building before approving an investor loan. If the paper says "Rentals Allowed" but the verified hash says "Prohibited," the bank avoids a high-risk loan.

**Property Managers**
**Uniform Enforcement:** Allowing on-site staff to instantly verify the latest rule text on their tablets during field enforcement.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Power Grab" Fraud Problem**

- **Ghost Amendments:** Rogue Board members fabricating a "Rule Change" PDF to target a specific neighbor they dislike, without a real vote.
- **Version Skew:** Intentionally providing an old version of the rules to a new buyer to hide a controversial recent assessment or restriction.
- **Fine Inflation:** Editing a PDF to change a $50 fine to $500 to extract more cash from residents.

**Issuer Types**

**Property Management Firms:** (e.g., Associa, FirstService).
**HOA Secretary / Boards.**
**County Recorders:** (If the bylaws are officially filed).

## Competition vs. HOA Web Portals

| Feature | OCR-to-Hash | Private Resident Portal | Scanned PDF / Email |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Bound to the HOA. | **System-Bound.** | **Zero.** Easily forged. |
| **User Access** | **Universal.** Share with any buyer/lawyer. | **Restricted.** Third parties never get resident logins. | **Universal.** |
| **Integrity** | **Binds Text.** Protects the fine-print. | **Vulnerable.** Portal can be "Cleaned up" by admins. | **Zero.** |
| **Persistence** | **High.** Text remains verifiable post-sale. | **Low.** Access revoked after moving out. | **Vulnerable.** |

**Why OCR wins here:** The "Handoff Gap." HOA portals are private silos. When a home is sold, the "Trust" must cross from the Seller (Member) to the Buyer (Non-Member). OCR-to-hash turns the **Paper Rules** into a portable, cryptographically trusted link that bridges the gap between residents and the outside world.
