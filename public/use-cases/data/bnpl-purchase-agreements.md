## Data Verified

Borrower name, merchant name, loan ID, total amount financed, Annual Percentage Rate (APR), payment schedule (e.g., 12 months), monthly payment amount, date of agreement.

**Document Types:**
- **Retail Installment Contract:** The legal loan document.
- **Truth in Lending Act (TILA) Disclosure:** Federal mandatory disclosure.
- **Payment Receipt:** Proving a specific installment was paid.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`affirm.com`, `klarna.com`) and current loan status.

**Status Indications:**
- **Active** — Loan is in good standing; payments current.
- **Paid in Full** — Debt satisfied.
- **In-Arrears** — Payment overdue (critical for credit checking).
- **Charged-Off** — Uncollectible debt.

## Second-Party Use

The **Borrower** (second party) receives the loan agreement from the BNPL provider (first party), **keeps it**, and may later hand it to third parties for various reasons, or never do so.

**Personal Record:** They have their own verified copy of the loan terms. Most of the time, the document sits in their email or financial records—the verification value is latent, there *if needed*.

**Peace of Mind:** They can confirm at any time that the agreement matches what the BNPL provider's system recorded and hasn't been altered.

**Future Optionality:** If a dispute arises—whether with the merchant about the purchase or with a future lender about debt obligations—they have cryptographic proof ready without needing to contact Affirm or Klarna.

## Third-Party Use

The borrower (second party) may hand the verified document to various third parties:

**Mortgage Lenders / Banks**
**Debt-to-Income (DTI) Calculation:** Many BNPL loans do not appear on traditional credit reports. Lenders can scan the applicant's verified BNPL agreements to get a true picture of their monthly debt obligations.

**Credit Bureaus**
**Data Accuracy:** Verifying that the data being reported by the BNPL provider matches the original agreement signed by the consumer.

**Legal Aid / Consumer Advocates**
**Predatory Lending Checks:** Instantly verifying the "Truth in Lending" disclosures to ensure the actual APR matches the marketing claims.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Ghost Debt" Fraud Problem**

- **Undisclosed Liabilities:** Borrowers hiding multiple BNPL loans from a mortgage lender by editing the PDF "Balance" or "Monthly Payment."
- **Terms Manipulation:** Changing a "20% APR" agreement to read "0% APR" to qualify for a different financial product.
- **Identity Theft:** Fraudsters taking out BNPL loans in a victim's name; verification allows the victim to see the "Official" data being used for the loan.

**Issuer Types (First Party)**

- BNPL Providers (Affirm, Klarna, PayPal Credit)
- Fintech Banks (Cross River Bank, Celtic Bank who originate the loans)

**Privacy Salt:** Not required. BNPL agreements contain many unpredictable variables that combine to create high entropy: unique loan IDs, borrower names, specific merchant names, exact financing amounts (down to the cent), precise dates, and unique APR calculations. The combination of these elements makes it computationally infeasible to reverse-engineer the hash through enumeration, even if some individual fields (like common APR tiers) are predictable.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing

A jurisdiction may require BNPL providers to retain a **witnessing firm** for regulatory compliance. The witnessing firm:

- Receives all hashes from the BNPL provider, and any subsequent changes to the loan as they happen—which may manifest as a new hash, a status change (paid, in-arrears, charged-off), or even a 404 (record deleted)
- Receives structured content/metadata (loan amounts, APR, payment schedules, merchant names)
- Does **NOT** receive plaintext (borrower SSN, full address, bank account details)
- Provides an immutable, timestamped audit trail—available to the jurisdiction on demand, to borrowers/third parties during disputes, or as expert witness testimony in legal proceedings

This provides:
- **Non-repudiation:** BNPL provider cannot deny issuing the loan terms
- **Timestamp proof:** Agreement hash existed at a specific time
- **Regulatory audit:** CFPB or state consumer protection agencies can inspect the witness ledger
- **Resilience:** Verification works even if BNPL provider's systems go down or the company exits the market

**Public Blockchain (Non-Party)**

Witnessing firms may periodically commit rollups to an inexpensive public blockchain, providing an ultimate immutability guarantee. The blockchain is a "non-party"—infrastructure, not a participant in the transaction. This creates multiple verification paths:

1. **BNPL provider domain** — Direct check against the issuer
2. **Witnessing firm** — Independent confirmation with timestamp
3. **Public blockchain** — Decentralized trust anchor via rollup inclusion

## Rationale

## Competition vs. Credit Reports (Experian/TransUnion)

| Feature | OCR-to-Hash | Credit Bureau Report | Paper Disclosure |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Completeness** | **High.** Catches "Off-Bureau" debt. | **Low.** Many BNPL providers don't report all loans. | **High.** But untrusted. |
| **Timeliness** | **Real-time.** Proves the loan status *today*. | **Laggy.** Updates take 30-60 days. | **Static.** |
| **Trust** | **Cryptographic.** Bound to the Lender. | **Reporting-Bound.** Relies on data file uploads. | **Zero.** |

**Why OCR wins here:** The "Shadow Credit" problem. BNPL is a multi-billion dollar industry that operates largely outside the view of traditional credit bureaus. OCR-to-hash brings this "Shadow Debt" into the light, allowing for responsible lending while preserving the consumer's ability to prove their own repayment history.
