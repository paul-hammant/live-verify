## What is a Wetlands Delineation Report?

In the land development industry, a **Wetlands Delineation Report** is the official environmental map of a property. It identifies the boundaries of "Jurisdictional Waters of the United States"—areas like marshes, bogs, and streams protected by the Clean Water Act.

These reports are "Development Killers." If a property is 50% wetlands, it may be impossible to build on. Fraud is high-stakes: developers often "edit" a report to turn a "High-Quality Wetland" into "Dry Land" on a PDF, or they "shrink" the boundaries of a protected stream to fit a new building. Verified hashes bind the **Wetland Acreage, Delineation Date, and Scientist's License** to the environmental firm's or the US Army Corps of Engineers' (USACE) domain.

## Data Verified

Report number, site name, parcel ID (APN), property address, total acreage surveyed, verified wetland acreage, wetland classification (e.g., Emergent, Forested, Scrub-Shrub), USACE jurisdictional status (JD), hydrology indicators, vegetation dominance results, hydric soil findings, scientist name/certification (PWS), date of survey.

**Document Types:**
- **Wetlands Delineation Report:** The primary scientific map.
- **Jurisdictional Determination (JD):** The formal USACE ruling.
- **Section 404 Mitigation Plan:** Proof of "Off-setting" wetland loss.
- **Critical Areas Report:** For local municipal compliance.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`eco-stream.com`, `usace.army.mil`, `epa.gov`) and the report standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Verified / Final** — The report matches the scientist's original field audit.
- **Superseded** — **ALERT:** A newer survey has found different boundaries (wetlands shift).
- **In Dispute** — **ALERT:** The USACE has rejected the boundaries found in this report.
- **Expired** — **ALERT:** The survey is more than 5 years old (statutory limit).

## Second-Party Use

The **Property Owner / Developer** benefits from verification.

**Land Valuation Speed:** When selling a multi-million dollar development site, the owner provides the verified hash of their "Clean" survey. The buyer's environmental underwriter can instantly see **"VERIFIED 0.00 ACRES WETLAND"** on their phone, allowing the sale to close without a 30-day "Due Diligence" wait for a new survey.

**Construction Permitting:** When submitting building plans, the developer provides the verified hash. The city's environmental clerk can instantly verify that the building footprint is outside the "Verified Wetland Buffer," speeding up the permit approval.

## Third-Party Use

**US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE)**
**Field Audit:** During a random check of a development site, the agent scans the report placard. OCR-to-hash ensures the contractor hasn't "Shrunk" the protected zone on the paper plans to allow for illegal filling of a stream.

**Lenders and Real Estate Appraisers**
**Collateral Risk Audit:** Before a bank lends $50M against a land parcel, they scan the verified environmental hashes. This ensures the "Developable Acreage" isn't a fabrication, protecting the bank from a future default caused by an un-buildable property.

**Environmental NGOs / Watchdogs**
**Conservation Monitoring:** A community group concerned about a local marsh can scan the developer's verified hash. Verification ensures the project is adhering to the *exact* boundaries required by federal law.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Wetland Shrinking" Fraud Problem**

- **Acreage Padding:** Changing a "10.0 Acre" wetland finding into a "1.0 Acre" finding on a PDF.
- **Jurisdiction Flipping:** Editing a report to change "JURISDICTIONAL" (Protected) to "NON-JURISDICTIONAL" (Un-protected).
- **Date Stretching:** Using a 10-year-old report (where wetlands were smaller) for a current project.

**Issuer Types**

**Certified Wetland Scientists (PWS).**
**Large Environmental Engineering Firms.**
**State/Federal Environmental Bureaus.**

**Privacy Salt:** Essential. Specific property boundaries and development plans are sensitive competitive data. The hash must be salted to prevent "Pipeline Mapping" by rival developers.

## Rationale

Wetlands are the "Filter of the Planet." By turning technical surveys into verifiable digital bridges, we ensure that land development is based on the digital truth of the ecosystem, protecting the environment and the multi-billion dollar real estate market from the high cost of scientific deception.
