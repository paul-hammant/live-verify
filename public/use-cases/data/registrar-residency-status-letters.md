## What is a Registrar Residency Letter?

A **Verification of Residency & Enrollment** is an official letter from a university registrar proving two critical facts:
1.  **Enrollment:** The student is currently taking classes (Full-Time/Part-Time).
2.  **Residency:** The student is legally a resident of the state (qualifying them for "In-State" tuition rates).

These letters are the "Benefit Unlockers" of the student world. They are used to qualify for **In-State Tuition** (saving $20,000+ per year), to remain on a parent's **Health Insurance**, and to secure **Student Visas**. Fraud is high-stakes: parents often "edit" a letter to claim in-state status for a different state, or students forge enrollment to stay on insurance while they aren't actually in school. Verified hashes bind the **Student ID, Residency Status, and Effective Dates** to the university registrar's domain (e.g., `berkeley.edu` or `ox.ac.uk`).

## Data Verified

Student name, Student ID, academic level (e.g., Freshman/Graduate), enrollment status (Full/Part Time), specific unit count, legal residency classification (In-State/Out-of-State), academic term (start/end dates), expected graduation date, registrar name/ID.

**Document Types:**
- **Enrollment Verification Letter:** For insurance and discounts.
- **Residency Certification:** For tuition rate qualification.
- **Good Standing Letter:** Proving academic integrity.
- **Intent to Graduate:** (Linked hash) for early job applications.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`berkeley.edu`, `utexas.edu`, `nyu.edu`) and the student's standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Verified / Enrolled** — Student is currently attending classes as stated.
- **Residency Confirmed** — The "In-State" status matches the university's legal audit.
- **Withdrawn** — **ALERT:** The student has dropped all classes since issuance.
- **Academic Leave** — **ALERT:** Student is in good standing but not currently enrolled.

## Second-Party Use

The **Student (Subject)** benefits from verification.

**Tuition Savings:** When moving between state-university systems, the student provide the verified hash of their "Residency Status." The new university can instantly see **"VERIFIED CALIFORNIA RESIDENT"** on their phone, allowing them to grant the lower tuition rate without a 3-month manual paper-audit.

**Insurance Coverage:** Proving to a parent's health insurer that they are a "Full-Time Student" to remain on the family plan until age 26. Verified hashes eliminate the "Insurance Audit" friction where students are dropped from plans due to un-readable paper letters.

## Third-Party Use

**Health Insurance Carriers**
**Eligibility Vetting:** Instead of manually reviewing 50,000 "Enrollment Letters" every September, the carrier's system scans the hashes. Verification ensures the students aren't "Padding" their status to keep coverage illegally.

**Government Agencies (DHS / ICE)**
**Visa Compliance:** Verifying that an international student is maintaining the "Full-Time" enrollment required by their F-1 visa status. OCR-to-hash connects the officer directly to the registrar's data, stopping "Ghost Enrollment" scams.

**Student Discount Platforms (UNiDAYS / ID.me)**
**Identity Verification:** Instantly verifying student status for high-value discounts (e.g., 50% off laptops or software).

## Verification Architecture

**The "Residency Ringer" Fraud Problem**

- **Tuition Evasion:** Editing a "Non-Resident" letter to read "Resident" to save $20,000 in tuition fees.
- **Enrollment Padding:** Changing a "6-unit" (Part-Time) enrollment to "12-units" (Full-Time) to keep a visa or insurance.
- **Date Stretching:** Using a 2024 enrollment letter for a 2026 benefit claim.

**Issuer Types**

**University Registrar Offices.**
**Community College Business Offices.**
**National Student Clearinghouse (Consortium).**

**Privacy Salt:** Critical. Student enrollment and residency are protected under FERPA (in the US). The hash must be salted to prevent "Student List Scraping" by data brokers or credit card marketers.

## Rationale

University registrar letters are the "Keys to Subsidies." By turning static letters into verifiable digital bridges, we protect the financial integrity of state university systems and ensure that benefits go to the legitimate students who truly meet the residency rules.
