## What is a Certificate of Authenticity (COA)?

In the art world, the painting itself is only half the value. The other half is the **COA**—the paper proving it was actually made by the artist.

A **COA** is issued by the artist's estate or a top-tier gallery. Without a verified COA, a multimillion-dollar Basquiat or Warhol is nearly impossible to sell.

Forgeries are common. Fraudsters often forge the "paperwork" (the COA) using fake letterheads and signatures to "prove" that a fake painting is real.

## Data Verified

Artist name, artwork title, creation year, medium, dimensions, edition number (if applicable), unique certificate ID, archive/registration number, name of the authenticating authority.

**Document Types:**
- **Artist COA:** Signed by the living artist.
- **Estate COA:** Issued by the artist's foundation after death.
- **Gallery COA:** Issued by the primary representing gallery.
- **Catalogue Raisonné Extract:** Official scholarly entry.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`basquiat-estate.org`, `gagosian.com`) and the status of the work.

**Status Indications:**
- **Verified** — The work is recognized as authentic by the authority.
- **Disputed** — The work is currently under scholarly review or litigation.
- **Invalid** — The certificate is a known forgery or the work has been de-authenticated.
- **Stolen** — The work is registered on the Art Loss Register.

## Second-Party Use

The **Art Owner** benefits from verification.

**Market Value Retention:** A Basquiat with a "Verified by Estate" digital status is worth millions more than one with a "doubtful" paper certificate. Verification protects the asset's value.

**Cross-Border Shipping:** Proving to Customs that the work is a genuine cultural artifact (and not a "fake" used for money laundering or smuggling).

## Third-Party Use

**Prospective Buyers**
**Due Diligence:** High-end art transactions happen in hours. Scanning the COA hash instantly proves provenance, allowing the buyer to wire funds with confidence before the "sale of the century" goes to someone else.

**Auction Houses (Consignment)**
**Intake Integrity:** Specialists can instantly filter out high-quality forgeries by scanning COAs during the intake process, protecting the auction house's reputation.

**Lenders (Art-Backed Loans)**
**Collateral Verification:** Private banks verify the COA before issuing multimillion-dollar lines of credit backed by the art.

## Verification Architecture

**The Art Forgery Problem**

- **Certificate Forgery:** It is often easier to forge a piece of paper (the COA) than to forge a Basquiat canvas. Fraudsters create fake estate letters to "legitimize" fake paintings.
- **Provenance Laundering:** Creating a fake chain of ownership (COAs from defunct galleries) to hide that a painting was created in a basement last week.
- **Double-Issue:** Selling the same painting multiple times to different buyers using duplicate forged certificates.

**Issuer Types**

**Artist Estates:** (e.g., Warhol Foundation, Basquiat Estate).
**Major Galleries:** (Gagosian, Pace, Hauser & Wirth).
**Scholarly Committees:** Dedicated authentication boards.

## Competition vs. NFTs / Blockchain

| Feature | OCR-to-Hash | NFT (Digital Twin) | Physical Seal (Microchip) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Physical Link** | **Textual.** Binds the *claim* to the art. | **None.** The token is on-chain; the art is off-chain. Easy to "de-couple." | **Mechanical.** A chip is glued/embedded in the frame. |
| **Market Standard** | **High.** Matches the traditional "Paper COA" culture of high-end art. | **Low.** High-end collectors are skeptical of crypto-volatility and tech-debt. | **Medium.** Seen as invasive by some conservators. |
| **Durability** | **Durable.** Text is archival. | **Fragile.** Requires the blockchain/IPFS to exist in 100 years. | **Fragile.** Chips can break or be removed. |

**Why OCR wins here:** The high-end art world is traditional. It relies on scholarly provenance and paper records. OCR-to-hash respects this tradition while adding a modern "Digital Seal." It doesn't require collectors to understand crypto-wallets; it just requires them to trust the **Domain Name** of the estate, which is the most stable form of digital identity.
