## Data Verified

Artist name, artwork title, medium and materials, dimensions, creation date or period, edition information (for prints/multiples), certificate issuer identity, issuer relationship to artist (gallery, estate, foundation, catalogue raisonné author), owner name (current or at issuance), unique identifiers, provenance summary, condition notes at issuance.

**Certificate Types:**
- **Artist-Issued COA:** Signed directly by the artist
- **Estate COA:** Issued by artist's estate after death
- **Foundation COA:** From artist's foundation or trust
- **Gallery COA:** From representing gallery
- **Auction House Documentation:** Provenance from major auction houses
- **Catalogue Raisonné Entry:** Scholarly documentation of work
- **Conservation Reports:** Professional condition assessments
- **Appraisal Documents:** Professional valuation with authenticity statement

**OCR Challenges:** Art certificates often feature decorative typography, artist signatures as images, gallery logos, and artistic layouts. Verification may require OCR-optimized certificate design or focus on structured data elements rather than decorative text.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (the gallery, estate, foundation, or authentication body) and the responder text.

**Status Indications:**
- **Verified** - Certificate matches issuer's records
- **Superseded** - Updated certificate issued (ownership change, conservation)
- **Disputed** - Authenticity under scholarly dispute
- **Withdrawn** - Issuer has withdrawn authentication
- **Limited** - Verification with noted limitations

**Attribution Confidence:** Where applicable: "Verified - Attributed to [artist], catalogue raisonné #[number]."

## Verification Architecture

**The Art Forgery Problem**

Art fraud is sophisticated and pervasive:

- **Forged Artworks:** Fake works with fake COAs
- **Fake COAs for Genuine Works:** Real works with fabricated provenance
- **Impersonation:** COAs falsely claiming gallery/estate endorsement
- **Edition Fraud:** Unnumbered works from sold-out editions
- **Attribution Inflation:** Works by followers attributed to masters
- **Provenance Fabrication:** Invented ownership histories
- **Stolen Art with New COAs:** Laundering stolen works through false documentation

OCR-to-hash addresses fake and altered certificates. Domain binding verifies the claimed issuer actually issued the certificate.

**Authorities as Issuers**

Multiple parties authenticate art:

**Living Artists:** Direct authentication from the creator.

**Artist Estates:** Authentication committees after artist's death.

**Foundations:** Artist foundations (Warhol Foundation, Pollock-Krasner).

**Authentication Boards:** Formal scholarly committees.

**Catalogue Raisonné Authors:** Scholars compiling comprehensive catalogues.

**Major Galleries:** Representing galleries for contemporary artists.

Each maintains verification records for authentications they've issued.

**The Authentication Challenge**

Authentication is complex and sometimes controversial:

**Connoisseurship:** Expert eye-based attribution.

**Technical Analysis:** Scientific examination (pigment analysis, imaging).

**Provenance Research:** Documentary evidence of ownership history.

**Stylistic Analysis:** Comparison to known works.

**Catalogue Raisonné Inclusion:** Scholarly compilation of artist's works.

Verification confirms the COA exists; underlying authentication relies on issuer's expertise.

**Authentication Board Closures**

A notable trend affecting authentication:

**Liability Concerns:** Boards disbanded due to litigation costs.

**Warhol Board Closure:** 2011 closure after expensive lawsuits.

**Keith Haring Foundation:** Stopped authenticating in 2012.

**Ongoing Boards:** Some still operate (Pollock-Krasner).

**Scholar Authentication:** Individual scholars sometimes authenticate.

When boards close, existing COAs become more valuable—verification confirms the COA predates closure.

**Provenance Documentation**

Chain of ownership matters:

**Exhibition History:** Museum and gallery exhibitions.

**Publication History:** Books, catalogues, articles featuring the work.

**Sale History:** Auction and dealer transactions.

**Collection History:** Notable collections that owned the work.

**Gaps and Due Diligence:** Explaining ownership gaps, especially WWII era.

Verification may summarize: "Verified - Provenance documented to 1935, exhibited [locations]."

**Edition and Print Verification**

Multiples require special attention:

**Edition Size:** Total authorized impressions.

**Numbering:** Individual number within edition.

**Artist's Proofs:** AP, HC (hors commerce) designations.

**Printer/Publisher:** Who produced the edition.

**Posthumous Editions:** Works printed after artist's death.

Verification specifies: "Verified - 45/100 from edition of 100, published 1972."

**Conservation and Condition**

Condition affects value significantly:

**Condition Reports:** Professional assessment at points in time.

**Conservation Treatment:** Restoration, cleaning, stabilization.

**Damage History:** Prior damage and repairs.

**Environmental History:** Storage and display conditions.

Condition reports may be verified separately: "Verified - Condition report by [conservator], dated [date]."

**Digital Art and NFTs**

Emerging authentication challenges:

**Digital Native Works:** Art created digitally.

**NFT Documentation:** Blockchain-based ownership claims.

**Physical/Digital Pairs:** Physical works with digital components.

**Artist Verification:** Confirming digital works to artist's wallet.

For physical outputs of digital art, traditional COA verification applies. Native digital art has blockchain-based alternatives.

**Decorative Typography Considerations**

Art COAs present unique OCR challenges:

**Ornate Fonts:** Decorative typography difficult for OCR.

**Artist Signatures:** Handwritten signatures as images.

**Gallery Logos:** Complex graphical elements.

**Watermarks and Security Features:** Embedded security elements.

**Recommended Approach:** Include structured data block with verification essentials alongside decorative presentation.

**Catalogue Raisonné Integration**

The scholarly record:

**CR Numbers:** Unique identifier in catalogue raisonné.

**Online Catalogues:** Some now maintained digitally.

**Supplements:** Updates to published catalogues.

**Disputed Works:** Works excluded or under review.

Verification may reference: "Verified - Catalogue raisonné: [Author], #[number], vol. [X], p. [Y]."

**International Considerations**

Global art market:

**Cross-Border Sales:** Authentication recognized internationally.

**Droit de Suite:** Artist resale rights in some jurisdictions.

**Import/Export:** Cultural property documentation.

**Restitution Claims:** Nazi-era and colonial provenance research.

**Language:** COAs may be in multiple languages.

Verification architecture must accommodate international documentation practices.
