## What is an EEO Poster?

By federal law, every workplace in America must display the **Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO)** poster. It tells employees that it is illegal to discriminate against them based on race, religion, sex, or disability.

These posters are "Mandatory Workplace Postings." If they are outdated (e.g., missing new laws like the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act), the company can be fined $10,000 or more.

Small businesses are often scammed by "Poster Vendors" who charge $200 for these posters. OCR-to-hash allows a business to print the official government PDF for free and verify that it is the **current, legal version** required by the EEOC.

## Data Verified

Poster version ID (e.g., 2026-A), issuing authority (EEOC), mandated text integrity, employer name (if custom-printed), effective date of policy changes, accessibility status (e.g., Audio/Braille link).

**Document Types:**
- **Federal EEO Poster:** The standard legal notice.
- **State-Specific EEO Notice:** Covering local laws (e.g., California Fair Employment).
- **Sexual Harassment Prevention Poster:** Mandatory in many jurisdictions.
- **Pay Transparency Notice:** Listing required salary range disclosures.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`eeoc.gov`) and the version status.

**Status Indications:**
- **Current** — Poster contains the latest mandatory legal language.
- **Outdated** — Law has changed; employer must replace the poster (e.g., new "Pregnant Workers" act language).
- **Void** — Poster retracted due to error in translation or text.
- **Informational** — No longer mandatory but remains for archival purposes.

## Second-Party Use

The **Employer** benefits from verification.

**Compliance Shield:** Proving to a labor law inspector that the "EEO Poster" in the breakroom is the **Verified Current Version**. This prevents the $10,000+ fines often issued for "Outdated Labor Law Postings" during routine audits.

**Digital Compliance:** Proving that the "EEO Link" in the corporate Intranet or Slack channel is verified authentic, fulfilling the requirements for "Remote Worker Notification."

## Third-Party Use

**Employees**
**Rights Awareness:** Scanning the poster to verify that the "Complaint Process" listed is the official one. Verification prevents "Fake Postings" where a dishonest manager might list a non-functioning email address to discourage reporting.

**Labor Law Inspectors**
**Rapid Audit:** During a surprise site visit, the inspector can scan the bulletin board. "Verified by eeoc.gov" allows the inspector to focus on other safety risks instead of reading the fine print of every poster.

**Union Organizers**
**Workplace Fairness:** Ensuring that management is providing accurate and verified information about employee civil rights.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Poster Scam" Fraud Problem**

- **Compliance Scams:** Private companies scaring small businesses into buying $200 "Mandatory Poster Bundles" that are actually outdated or unnecessary. A verified hash allows the business to see the "Official Free Version."
- **Language Alteration:** Editing the text to remove mention of "Gender Identity" or "Religious Accommodation" to mislead employees about their rights.
- **Status Faking:** Displaying an old 2018 poster in 2026 to hide new legal protections from workers.

**Issuer Types**

**U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC):** (The primary authority).
**U.S. Department of Labor (DOL).**
**State Fair Employment Agencies.**

## Competition vs. Poster Bundle Vendors

| Feature | OCR-to-Hash | Private Poster Vendor | Gov PDF Printout |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Bound to `eeoc.gov`. | **Brand-Bound.** Trust the vendor. | **Visual.** |
| **Cost** | **Free.** (Marginal hosting). | **High.** $100-$300/year for updates. | **Free.** |
| **Freshness** | **Real-time.** Shows if outdated today. | **Laggy.** Depends on mail delivery. | **None.** |
| **Integrity** | **Cryptographic.** Protects every word. | **Zero.** Easily edited. | **Vulnerable.** |

**Why OCR wins here:** The "Mandatory Update" problem. Labor laws change every year. Employers currently waste millions of dollars on "Subscription Poster Services." OCR-to-hash turns the **One-Time Printout** into a dynamic compliance tool that tells the employer *exactly* when it needs to be swapped, saving money and increasing legal protection.
