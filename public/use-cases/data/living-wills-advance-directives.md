## Data Verified

Declarant name, date of birth, appointed Health Care Agent (Proxy) name, specific life-sustaining treatment choices (Yes/No), comfort care directives, organ donor status, date of execution, witness names, Notary commission (if applicable), issuing healthcare system/attorney domain.

**Document Types:**
- **Living Will:** Specific instructions for terminal conditions.
- **Healthcare Power of Attorney:** Appointing a decision-maker.
- **POLST / MOLST Form:** Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment (for the fridge).
- **Five Wishes Document:** A comprehensive family-centered directive.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`cedars-sinai.org`, `mayoclinic.org`, `legalzoom.com`) and current document status.

**Status Indications:**
- **Active** — This is the latest verified directive on file.
- **Superseded** — **ALERT:** A newer directive has been issued; this version is void.
- **Revoked** — Declarant has formally cancelled this directive.
- **Under Challenge** — Legal dispute regarding the declarant's competency at signing.

## Second-Party Use

The **Patient (Declarant)** benefits from verification.

**Ensuring Compliance:** Proving to a hospital's ethics committee or a hesitant doctor that their "End-of-Life Wishes" are verified and un-altered. Verification prevents family members from "Losing" or "Editing" a paper directive to keep a patient on life-support against their verified will.

**Portability:** Carrying a verified digital link to their living will while traveling, ensuring their wishes are respected in a different state or country where their local doctor isn't available.

## Third-Party Use

**Hospital Ethics Committees / ER Staff**
**Immediate Action:** In a trauma situation where a patient is unconscious, doctors scan the hash on the "POLST" card. "Verified by Cedars-Sinai" provides the immediate legal and ethical cover needed to follow the patient's "No Intubation" wish without fear of a lawsuit from relatives.

**Health Care Agents (Proxies)**
**Authority Proof:** Proving to a nursing home or insurance company that they are the verified, legally appointed decision-maker for the patient.

**Probate Attorneys**
**Estate Integrity:** Ensuring that the healthcare decisions made at the end of life were consistent with the verified legal documents in the estate file.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Daughter from California" Fraud Problem**

- **Directive Hiding:** Relatives intentionally hiding a "No Life Support" document to keep a patient alive for social or financial reasons. Verification allows the hospital to check the domain record directly.
- **Content Alteration:** Editing a PDF to change the "Health Care Agent" from a spouse to a predatory stranger.
- **Competency Fraud:** Fabricating an advance directive after a patient has already lost mental capacity (Dementia/Coma).

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**Healthcare Systems:** (Kaiser, Mayo Clinic, HCA).
**Online Legal Services:** (LegalZoom, RocketLawyer).
**State Registries:** (e.g., California Secretary of State Advance Directive Registry).

**Privacy Salt:** ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL. End-of-life wishes are the most private data imaginable. The hash MUST be salted to prevent "Guess-and-Check" attacks to find someone's medical directives.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing

A jurisdiction may require the issuer to retain a **witnessing firm** for regulatory compliance. The witnessing firm:

- Receives all hashes from the issuer, and any subsequent changes to the payload as they happen—which may manifest as a new hash, a status change, or even a 404 (record deleted)
- Receives structured content/metadata (key identifiers and dates)
- Does **NOT** receive plaintext or sensitive personal information
- Provides an immutable, timestamped audit trail—available to the jurisdiction on demand, to document holders/third parties during disputes, or as expert witness testimony in legal proceedings

This provides:
- **Non-repudiation:** Issuer cannot deny issuing the document
- **Timestamp proof:** Document existed at a specific time
- **Regulatory audit:** Jurisdictions can inspect the witness ledger for fraud detection
- **Resilience:** Verification works even if issuer's systems go down

**Public Blockchain (Non-Party)**

Witnessing firms may periodically commit rollups to an inexpensive public blockchain, providing an ultimate immutability guarantee. The blockchain is a "non-party"—infrastructure, not a participant in the transaction. This creates multiple verification paths:

1. **Issuer domain** — Direct check against the issuer
2. **Witnessing firm** — Independent confirmation with timestamp
3. **Public blockchain** — Decentralized trust anchor via rollup inclusion


## Competition vs. State Registries

| Feature | OCR-to-Hash | State Registry (Online) | The "Fridge" Magnet |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Bound to the Hospital/Firm. | **Gov-Bound.** Bound to the State. | **None.** Trust the paper. |
| **Integrity** | **Cryptographic.** Protects every wish. | **Data-Only.** Doesn't protect the paper. | **Zero.** Easily forged. |
| **Speed** | **Instant.** 5-second scan. | **Slow.** Requires login/fees and manual search. | **Instant.** |
| **Freshness** | **Real-time.** Shows if superseded. | **Laggy.** Updates take weeks. | **Static.** |

**Why OCR wins here:** The "ICU Reality." Decisions in the ICU are made in minutes. Doctors don't have time to navigate a state government website or pay a $10 fee to see a directive. OCR-to-hash turns the **Paper on the Clipboard** into a live, trusted clinical link, ensuring the patient's dignity is protected by the latest technology.
