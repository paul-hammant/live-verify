## What is a Financial Promotions Sign-Off?

In regulated financial services, you can't just run any advertisement you like. Marketing materials for investment products must be **approved by an authorized person** before publication.

The sign-off confirms: this promotion is fair, clear, and not misleading. It's balanced. It includes required risk warnings. An authorized person has reviewed it and takes responsibility.

## Data Verified

**Promotion ID**, **campaign name**, **channels**, **approval date**, **approving officer** (name and function), **firm name**, **FRN**, **key compliance certifications**, **validity period**.

## Data Visible After Verification

**Status Indications:**
- **Approved** — Promotion currently authorized for use
- **Expired** — Approval period ended, must be renewed or withdrawn
- **Withdrawn** — Promotion pulled from use (regulatory concern, product change)
- **Under Investigation** — Regulator reviewing the promotion
- **Breach Found** — Promotion found to violate rules

## The Section 21 Problem (UK)

Under FSMA Section 21, only FCA-authorized firms can approve financial promotions. Unauthorized firms (e.g., appointed representatives, overseas firms) must get an authorized firm to sign off their marketing.

This creates a market for "s21 approvers" — authorized firms that review and approve promotions for a fee. Quality varies widely. The FCA has cracked down on poor approvals, especially for high-risk investments.

## Jurisdiction Differences

| Jurisdiction | Regulator | Framework | Key Requirements |
|--------------|-----------|-----------|------------------|
| **UK** | FCA | FSMA s21, COBS 4 | Authorized person must approve; fair, clear, not misleading |
| **US** | FINRA, SEC | Rule 2210, Investment Advisers Act | Principal pre-approval for most comms; filing requirements |
| **EU** | National + ESMA | MiFID II marketing rules | Clear, fair, not misleading; risk warnings |

US FINRA requires firms to file certain ads; UK FCA doesn't require pre-filing but can request any promotion at any time.

## Third-Party Use

**Media platforms** — Verify ad is legitimately approved before running (Google, Meta increasingly checking)
**Regulators** — Investigations into misleading promotions
**Consumers** — Verify that investment offer they received is genuinely approved
**Litigation** — Evidence in mis-selling cases ("the promotion was approved and compliant")

## Verification Architecture

**The Problem:**
- Unauthorized promotions circulate claiming to be approved
- Approved promotions continue running after withdrawal
- Approving firms deny having signed off after problems emerge
- Consumers can't verify if a social media ad is legitimately approved

**The Fix:** Approval document hashed at sign-off. Marketing materials reference the verification URL. Consumer or platform can verify: this exact promotion was approved by an authorized firm. If approval is withdrawn, verification status changes immediately — every instance of the promotion becomes verifiable as "withdrawn."

**Crypto/high-risk investment angle:** The FCA's new rules (2023+) require all crypto promotions to be approved by an authorized firm. Many scam promotions circulate without approval. Verification would let consumers instantly check if a crypto ad is legitimately approved or fraudulent.
