## What is a Financial Promotions Sign-Off?

In the regulated financial world, you cannot simply publish an ad for an investment. Under laws like **Section 21 (FSMA)** in the UK or **FINRA Rule 2210** in the US, every marketing piece (an email, a social media ad, or a brochure) must be formally **Approved** by a qualified compliance officer. This "Sign-Off" confirms the ad is "Fair, Clear, and Not Misleading."

These documents are the "Legal Safe Harbor" for marketing. Fraud is high-stakes in the **Crypto** and **High-Yield Bond** sectors. Scammers often use a reputable bank's logo on their ads and then create a fake "Compliance Approval" PDF to trick platforms like Meta or Google into running the ad. Verified hashes bind the **Promotion ID, Campaign Name, and Approving Officer** to the authorized firm's domain (e.g., `meridian-funds.com`).

## Data Verified

Promotion ID, campaign name, approved media channels, date of approval, expiration date of sign-off, name of authorized firm (and FRN), name/ID of the approving individual, specific risk-warning text hash, target audience classification (e.g., Retail/Professional).

**Document Types:**
- **s21 Approval Certificate:** The formal sign-off page.
- **Compliance Monitoring Log:** Proof of ongoing ad-review.
- **Principal Pre-Approval Form:** (FINRA) for US-based comms.
- **Risk Disclosure Addendum:** (Linked hash) for high-risk products.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`meridian-funds.com`, `gs.com`, `fca.org.uk`) and the ad standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Approved / Active** — The ad is current and authorized for publication.
- **Withdrawn** — **CRITICAL:** The ad has been pulled from use (must be removed immediately).
- **Expired** — **ALERT:** The 12-month approval window has passed.
- **Under Investigation** — **ALERT:** The regulator has flagged this specific campaign for review.

## Second-Party Use

The **Marketing Team / Unauthorized Firm** benefits from verification.

**Platform Acceptance Speed:** When a startup tries to run a crypto ad on Meta or Google, they must prove they have an s21 sign-off. By providing the verified hash, the platform's "Compliance Bot" can instantly see **"VERIFIED BY MERIDIAN"** on the official domain, removing the 5-day "Manual Ad-Vetting" delay and allowing the campaign to launch today.

**Brand Protection:** A fund manager can provide verified hashes of their ads to their "Affiliate Partners." This ensures the affiliates are using the *correct, approved* versions of the ads and haven't "edited" them to make unauthorized claims.

## Third-Party Use

**Advertising Platforms (Meta, Google, LinkedIn)**
**Ad-Integrity Vetting:** Automatically scanning the hashes provided in every financial ad submission. Verified hashes eliminate the risk of "Regulatory Fines" for the platform by ensuring every financial ad is backed by a legitimate, authorized firm.

**National Regulators (FCA / FINRA)**
**Market Surveillance:** Instead of searching for ads manually, the regulator can use a crawler to scan hashes on live websites. OCR-to-hash ensures the ads on the screen match the "Approved Copy" in the firm's compliance files, stopping "Bait and Switch" marketing.

**Consumers / Retail Investors**
**Scam Prevention:** A person sees an "Amazing Crypto Deal" on social media. They scan the verified hash on the ad. If it returns **"NOT FOUND"** or **"DOMAIN MISMATCH,"** they know the ad is a scam and can avoid a total loss of funds.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Phantom Approval" Fraud Problem**

- **Firm Mimicry:** Using a reputable bank's branding on a fake approval form to get a scam ad through a social media filter.
- **Date Stretching:** Using an approval from 2023 for a 2026 campaign to hide that the product terms have changed.
- **Copy Inflation:** Editing an approved ad to turn a "5% Return" into a "50% Return" while keeping the old verified hash reference.

**Issuer Types**

**Authorized Financial Firms (FCA/FINRA).**
**Compliance Consultancies (as sub-issuers).**
**National Regulators (in some jurisdictions).**

**Privacy Salt:** Low to Medium. While ad-copy is public, internal compliance officer IDs should be salted to protect individual privacy.

## Rationale

Financial promotions are the "Front Line of Consumer Risk." By turning sign-offs into verifiable digital bridges, we protect the public from predatory marketing and ensure that "Investor Trust" is backed by the cryptographic truth of the compliance office.
