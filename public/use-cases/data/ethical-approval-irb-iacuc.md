## Data Verified

Protocol ID, Principal Investigator (PI) name, study title (digest), IRB/IACUC committee ID, risk level classification, approval date, expiration date, number of subjects authorized, specific interventions allowed.

**Document Types:**
- **IRB Approval Letter:** For human subjects research.
- **IACUC Approval Letter:** For animal research.
- **Continuing Review Approval:** Annual renewal of ethics.
- **Exemption Notice:** For low-risk data-only research.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`stanford.edu`, `nih.gov`) and current approval status.

**Status Indications:**
- **Approved** — Research is authorized and ethically vetted.
- **Expired** — Approval has lapsed; data collection must stop.
- **Suspended** — Halted due to an adverse event or ethics violation.
- **Closed** — Study completed; final report filed.

## Second-Party Use

The **Principal Investigator (PI)** benefits from verification.

**Grant Funding:** Proving to a funding agency (e.g., NIH or NSF) that they have "Verified Ethical Approval" for their study. This is often a "Hard Stop" requirement before grant money is released.

**Publication Submission:** Providing a verified link to the IRB approval in a manuscript submission to a major journal (e.g., Nature or Science), proving the study was conducted under official oversight.

**Cross-Institutional Collaboration:** Proving to a partner university's compliance office that the primary site's IRB has already verified and approved the protocol.

## Third-Party Use

**Academic Journals / Editors**
**Integrity Review:** Instantly verifying that the "IRB Number" cited in a research paper is authentic and matches the study title/dates. This prevents "Ethics Fabrications" in high-profile research.

**Regulatory Agencies (FDA / OHRP)**
**Audit Efficiency:** During a federal audit, inspectors can scan the hashes of all site approval letters to ensure they haven't been "Backdated" or "Self-Signed" by the PI.

**Clinical Trial Participants**
**Personal Safety:** A participant can scan the hash on the consent form. "Verified by Stanford IRB" provides the peace of mind that the study is legitimate and overseen by a real ethics committee.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Ethics Forgery" Fraud Problem**

- **Fabricated Approvals:** A researcher creating a fake "IRB Approved" letter to bypass university rules or to get a paper published.
- **Scope Creep:** Taking an approval for "Survey Research" and using the paper to hide invasive "Clinical Sampling" that the IRB never saw.
- **Date Alteration:** Changing a 2022 approval to 2026 to hide that the study has been operating without oversight for years.

**Issuer Types**

**Universities:** (Stanford, Harvard, Oxford).
**Commercial IRBs:** (e.g., WCG, Advarra - for private pharma trials).
**Government Research Offices.**

**Privacy Salt:** Critical. Study titles can reveal sensitive disease research or vulnerable populations. The hash must be salted to prevent "Guessing" which PIs are working on specific sensitive topics.

## Competition vs. IRB Management Systems (Click/InfoEd)

| Feature | OCR-to-Hash | IRB Portal (Click/InfoEd) | Scanned PDF Letter |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Bound to the University. | **System-Bound.** Trust the DB admin. | **Zero.** Easily forged. |
| **Interoperability** | **Universal.** Works across any institution. | **Low.** Journal editors don't have Click logins. | **Universal.** |
| **Integrity** | **Binds Scope.** Protects the study title. | **Data-Only.** | **Vulnerable.** |
| **Speed** | **Instant.** 5-second scan. | **Slow.** Requires manual search by ID. | **N/A.** |

**Why OCR wins here:** The "External Review" gap. Ethics committees operate in private silos. Journals, funders, and the public are locked out. OCR-to-hash turns the **Internal Ethical Approval** into a portable, cryptographically trusted artifact that bridges the gap between institutional oversight and the global scientific community.
