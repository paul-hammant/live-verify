    "rationale": "Hotels, bouncers, car rentals, and transit workers already see ID cards but often can't trust the card is still valid or authentic. Flashing 'Claim Verified' for issuer-attested IDs lets them confirm the government domain currently vouches for that particular card text. This protects against simple forgeries without forcing staff to learn complex verification portals.",
