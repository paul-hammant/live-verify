## Data Verified

Insured name, policy number, Claim ID, adjusted loss amount (ACV/RCV), deductible amount, net settlement estimate, adjuster name/ID, inspection date, cause of loss code, issuance timestamp.

**Document Types:**
- **Preliminary Assessment:** The first field estimate.
- **Supplemental Report:** For hidden damage found mid-repair.
- **Liability Determination:** Formal letter stating who was at fault.
- **Salvage Evaluation:** For total loss vehicles/properties.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`progressive.com`, `geico.com`) and current claim status.

**Status Indications:**
- **Approved** — Estimate matches the carrier's final adjudication.
- **Paid** — Funds have been issued to the insured or vendor.
- **Supplemented** — **ALERT:** A newer version of this report exists.
- **Denied** — Coverage rejected (reason code verified).

## Second-Party Use

The **Policyholder (Insured)** benefits from verification.

**Body Shop / Contractor Negotiations:** Proving to a repair shop exactly what the insurance company has agreed to pay. Verification stops the shop from claiming "The insurance didn't cover the bumper" when the verified report says they did.

**Car Sale / Trade-in:** Providing a verified, un-altered "Damage History" to a buyer or dealer, proving the $12,000 repair was for cosmetic damage and not structural frame issues.

## Third-Party Use

**Repair Vendors (Body Shops / Electricians)**
**Payment Assurance:** Before starting work, the vendor scans the adjuster's hash. "Verified by Progressive" gives them the confidence that the funds are actually authorized and they won't be left with a denied supplement later.

**Subrogation Specialists**
**Liability Recovery:** Verifying the at-fault party's adjuster report to ensure the legal recovery amount matches the verified field assessment.

**Used Car Markets (CARFAX)**
**History Integrity:** Ensuring that the "Accident History" reported by the owner matches the verified insurance company record, stopping the "PDF Scrubbing" of past high-value claims.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Estimate Padding" Fraud Problem**

- **Supplement Forgery:** A shop creating a fake "Adjuster Approval" for $2,000 in extra parts that were never authorized.
- **Deductible Deception:** A shop editing the PDF to hide that the owner has a $1,000 deductible, attempting to "waive" it by over-charging the insurer.
- **Identity Theft:** Using a real adjuster's name and license # on a fake "Passing" report for a total-loss vehicle.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**Primary Carriers:** (Progressive, State Farm, Allstate).
**Adjusting Software:** (e.g., CCC One, Mitchell, Xactimate - hosting the data hashes).
**Independent Adjusting Firms.**

## Jurisdictional Witnessing

A jurisdiction may require the issuer to retain a **witnessing firm** for regulatory compliance. The witnessing firm:

- Receives all hashes from the issuer, and any subsequent changes to the payload as they happen—which may manifest as a new hash, a status change, or even a 404 (record deleted)
- Receives structured content/metadata (key identifiers and dates)
- Does **NOT** receive plaintext or sensitive personal information
- Provides an immutable, timestamped audit trail—available to the jurisdiction on demand, to document holders/third parties during disputes, or as expert witness testimony in legal proceedings

This provides:
- **Non-repudiation:** Issuer cannot deny issuing the document
- **Timestamp proof:** Document existed at a specific time
- **Regulatory audit:** Jurisdictions can inspect the witness ledger for fraud detection
- **Resilience:** Verification works even if issuer's systems go down

**Public Blockchain (Non-Party)**

Witnessing firms may periodically commit rollups to an inexpensive public blockchain, providing an ultimate immutability guarantee. The blockchain is a "non-party"—infrastructure, not a participant in the transaction. This creates multiple verification paths:

1. **Issuer domain** — Direct check against the issuer
2. **Witnessing firm** — Independent confirmation with timestamp
3. **Public blockchain** — Decentralized trust anchor via rollup inclusion


## Competition vs. Claims Dashboards

| Feature | OCR-to-Hash | Carrier Mobile App | Scanned PDF Report |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **User Control** | **High.** Share only the *Assessment*. | **Low.** App access reveals *full* account history. | **High.** |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Bound to the Carrier. | **System-Bound.** | **Zero.** Easily forged. |
| **Interoperability** | **High.** Verified PDF works for any body shop. | **Siloed.** | **Universal.** |
| **Persistence** | **High.** Remains verifiable after claim closes. | **Low.** Past claims often hidden in old menus. | **Vulnerable.** |

**Why OCR wins here:** The "Counter Reality." Decisions about repairs happen at the body shop or kitchen table. Vendors and buyers don't have logins to the carrier's private claims system. OCR-to-hash turns the **Static PDF Report** into a live digital checkpoint, ensuring the "Source of Truth" moves with the document.
