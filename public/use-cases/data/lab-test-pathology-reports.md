## Data Verified

Patient name, MRN/Accession number, specimen type (e.g., Blood/Tissue), specific test names, numerical results (e.g., TSH levels), qualitative diagnosis (e.g., "Malignant"), reference ranges, pathologist name/license, collection date, report date.

**Document Types:**
- **Pathology Report:** The high-stakes "Biopsy Result."
- **Standard Lab Panel:** (CBC, Lipid, Metabolic).
- **Toxicology Report:** Proving "Clean" or "Positive" status.
- **Genetic Screen:** Complex multi-page DNA analysis.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`questdiagnostics.com`, `labcorp.com`) and current report standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Final** — Report is complete and verified by the medical director.
- **Amended** — **ALERT:** Original result was corrected; this version is void.
- **Preliminary** — Initial findings only; do not base surgery on this version.
- **Cancelled** — Specimen was compromised; no result issued.

## Second-Party Use

The **Patient** benefits from verification.

**Second Opinions:** Proving to a specialist at a different hospital (e.g., MD Anderson) that the "Grade 2" diagnosis isn't a misprint. A verified hash from the original lab provides the consulting doctor with instant trust, bypassing the need for a manual wait for physical slides or redundant re-tests.

**Personal Health Records:** Carrying a verified, cryptographically trusted "Source of Truth" about their health, which can be shared with insurers or travel providers without revealing the entire medical history.

## Third-Party Use

**Specialist Physicians / Oncologists**
**Treatment Decisions:** Before starting chemotherapy or scheduling surgery, the doctor scans the pathology hash. "Verified by Quest" ensure the diagnosis hasn't been "Edited" by a patient in denial or a confused relative.

**Life & Disability Insurers**
**Risk Underwriting:** Verifying high-stakes health markers (like cancer staging) before issuing multimillion-dollar policies. OCR-to-hash connects the underwriter directly to the performing lab.

**Clinical Trial Monitors**
**Eligibility Vetting:** Ensuring that participants in a lung cancer trial actually have the "Verified Grade 2" diagnosis required by the protocol.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Medical Denial" Fraud Problem**

- **Diagnosis Scrubbing:** A patient editing a "Positive" cancer report to "Negative" to pass a life insurance exam or to hide a condition from a family member.
- **Result Padding:** Editing a "Normal" drug test to hide the presence of controlled substances.
- **Pathologist Impersonation:** Creating a fake report on the letterhead of a reputable lab to justify an experimental or unauthorized treatment.

**Issuer Types**

**National Reference Labs:** (Quest, LabCorp, ARUP).
**Hospital Labs:** (Academic medical center pathology units).
**Direct-to-Consumer Labs:** (e.g., Everlywell, Thorne).

**Privacy Salt:** ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL. Pathology data is the most sensitive PII. The hash MUST be salted to prevent "Guess-and-Check" attacks to find specific people with cancer or rare diseases.

## Competition vs. Patient Portals / HIEs

| Feature | OCR-to-Hash | Patient Portal (MyQuest) | Health Info Exchange (HIE) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Bound to the Lab. | **System-Bound.** Requires login. | **Network-Bound.** |
| **User Access** | **Instant.** Scan the paper in the clinic. | **Slow.** Requires patient to log in and find PDF. | **Difficult.** Requires clinical integration. |
| **Integrity** | **Cryptographic.** Binds the *Diagnosis*. | **High.** Direct DB access. | **High.** |
| **Cross-System** | **Universal.** Works across any health system. | **Siloed.** Hard to share with non-network doctors. | **Limited.** Regional only. |

**Why OCR wins here:** The "Clinical Handoff." Surgeons and Oncologists often meet patients who bring paper reports from outside labs. They don't have time to log into the patient's private Quest account. OCR-to-hash turns the **Physical Pathology Report** into a live, trusted clinical link that provides "Oncology-Grade" trust in seconds.
