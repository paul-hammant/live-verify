## What is a 501(c)(3) Letter?

A **501(c)(3) Determination Letter** is the official document from the IRS granting a non-profit organization tax-exempt status. It is the "Golden Ticket" of the charity world.

Without this letter:
1.  **Donors** cannot deduct their contributions.
2.  **Foundations** will not give grants.
3.  **Vendors** (like TechSoup or Microsoft) will not give non-profit discounts.

Charities often have to fax, email, or mail this letter dozens of times a year to prove their legitimacy.

    <p>We're pleased to tell you we determined you're exempt from federal income tax under Internal Revenue Code (IRC) Section 501(c)(3). Donors can deduct contributions they make to you under IRC Section 170. You're also qualified to receive tax deductible bequests, devises, transfers or gifts under Section 2055, 2106, or 2522.</p>

## Data Verified

Organization name, EIN (Employer Identification Number), effective date of exemption, public charity status classification, address at time of issuance.

**Document Types:**
- **Determination Letter (Form 1045)**
- **Affirmation Letter** (issued later to confirm status hasn't changed)

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (e.g., `irs.gov`) and current status.

**Status Indications:**
- **Valid** — Organization is currently exempt and in good standing.
- **Revoked** — Exemption was automatically revoked (e.g., for failure to file Form 990 for 3 years).
- **Suspended** — Under investigation or temporarily suspended.

## Second-Party Use

The **Non-Profit Organization** (second party) receives the determination letter from the IRS (first party), **keeps it**, and may later hand it to third parties for various reasons, or never do so.

**Personal Record:** The organization has their own verified copy of tax-exempt status. Most of the time, the document sits in organizational files—the verification value is latent, there *if needed*.

**Peace of Mind:** The organization can confirm at any time that the letter matches what the IRS's system recorded and hasn't been altered since they received it.

**Future Optionality:** If a grant application arises, a state registration is needed, or a donor questions their tax-deductibility, the organization has cryptographic proof ready without needing to contact the IRS.

## Third-Party Use

The non-profit organization (second party) may hand the verified document to various third parties:

**Donors and Foundations**
High-net-worth donors want absolute certainty that their large donation will be tax-deductible. Verifying the determination letter confirms the entity is legitimate and currently exempt.

**Corporate Matching Platforms**
Platforms like Benevity or CyberGrants verify charities before allowing employees to donate. Automation via OCR verification reduces manual review time.

**State Regulators**
State Attorneys General can verify the federal status of organizations soliciting funds in their jurisdiction.

## Verification Architecture

**The 501(c)(3) Fraud Problem**

- **Name Spoofing:** Creating a fake charity with a name very similar to a famous one (e.g., "Cancer Fund of America" vs "American Cancer Society").
- **Status Misrepresentation:** Claiming to be tax-exempt when the status was actually revoked years ago for non-filing.
- **Photoshop:** Altering an old determination letter to change the year or the address.

**Issuer Types (First Party)**

- Internal Revenue Service (IRS) — The sole authority for federal tax exemption

**Privacy Salt:** Not required. The determination letter contains highly unpredictable variables—unique EIN (Employer Identification Number), organization legal name variations, specific determination dates, and DLN (Document Locator Number). These elements combined provide sufficient entropy that enumeration attacks are infeasible. Adding salt would provide no additional security benefit.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing

A jurisdiction may require the IRS (or state-level equivalents) to retain a **witnessing firm** for regulatory compliance. The witnessing firm:

- Receives all hashes from the IRS, and any subsequent changes to the payload as they happen—which may manifest as a new hash, a status change (revoked, suspended), or even a 404 (record deleted)
- Receives structured content/metadata (organization name, EIN, exemption date, public charity classification)
- Does **NOT** receive plaintext (donor information, financial details)
- Provides an immutable, timestamped audit trail—available to the jurisdiction on demand, to organizations/third parties during disputes, or as expert witness testimony in legal proceedings

This provides:
- **Non-repudiation:** IRS cannot deny issuing the determination letter
- **Timestamp proof:** Exemption existed at a specific time
- **Regulatory audit:** State charity bureaus can inspect the witness ledger for fraud detection
- **Resilience:** Verification works even if IRS systems go down

**Jurisdictional Requirements (United States / IRS)**

The IRS does not mandate or recognize third-party witnessing firms for federal tax documents. The IRS maintains authoritative records within its own systems, and verification occurs via direct query to IRS endpoints.

However:
- **State tax authorities** may have different requirements (e.g., state-level charity registration requires independent witness firms)
- **International stakeholders** (foreign tax authorities, treaty partners) may demand independent verification from witness firms not located in the US
- **FATCA compliance** (Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act) may require US documents to be witnessed by non-US firms when shared across borders

**Verification Framework Differences**

The FATCA/CRS frameworks require geographic separation (independent witness firms outside the issuer's jurisdiction) for cross-border documents originating from certain financial centers. This reflects a principle of independent external verification for documents crossing regulatory jurisdictions.

The IRS maintains its own verification infrastructure for federal tax documents (501(c)(3) determination letters, EIN assignments, tax rulings). These documents are verified through direct IRS system queries rather than through independent witness firms. This represents a different verification model—issuer-maintained records for domestic purposes, with the expectation that treaty partners will conduct direct verification with the IRS.

Both models serve distinct purposes: FATCA/CRS-style geographic separation prevents collusion when documents enter non-issuing jurisdictions; issuer-maintained systems provide efficient verification for routine domestic transactions. As international document verification evolves, blockchain-based rollups and decentralized architectures may converge these models into infrastructure-neutral standards applicable across jurisdictions.

**Public Blockchain (Non-Party)**

Witnessing firms may periodically commit rollups to an inexpensive public blockchain, providing an ultimate immutability guarantee. The blockchain is a "non-party"—infrastructure, not a participant in the transaction. This creates multiple verification paths:

1. **IRS domain** — Direct check against the issuer
2. **Witnessing firm** — Independent confirmation with timestamp
3. **Public blockchain** — Decentralized trust anchor via rollup inclusion

## Competition vs. QR/NFC

| Feature | OCR-to-Hash | QR Code | Public Database Search |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Trust Model** | **Strong.** Links directly to `irs.gov`. | **Weak.** QR codes can point to `irs-gov-verify.com` (phishing site). | **Strong.** But requires manual data entry. |
| **User Experience** | **Fast.** Scan the letter -> verified. | **Fast.** Scan the code. | **Slow.** Type in EIN, solve CAPTCHA, find record. |
| **Offline Proof** | **Medium.** Hash proves integrity of the paper text. | **Low.** Just a link. | **None.** Requires internet to search DB. |
| **Phishing Resistance** | **High.** `verify:` line is human-readable. | **Low.** URL often hidden or truncated. | **N/A.** |

**Why OCR wins here:** The "Determination Letter" is a totem of legitimacy in the non-profit world. It is framed on walls, attached to grant PDFs, and mailed to donors. Preserving its visual dignity while adding verification is superior to plastering a QR code on a formal government letter. Furthermore, database searches are prone to user error (typos in EINs), whereas scanning the document itself eliminates entry errors.
