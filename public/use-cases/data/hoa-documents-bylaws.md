## What are HOA Bylaws?

If you live in a condo or a planned community, your daily life is governed by **HOA Bylaws** and **CC&Rs** (Covenants, Conditions & Restrictions). These are the "Constitution" of your neighborhood.

They define everything from how many pets you can have to whether you can paint your front door blue.

When you buy a house, you need the **Verified Current Version** of these rules. Sellers often "Hide" pages that mention expensive upcoming fees or strict rental bans to trick buyers. Verified hashes turn these 50-page PDFs into a live, trusted link to the association's official archive.

## Data Verified

HOA legal name, document title (Bylaws/CC&Rs), adoption date, revision version, total page count, Secretary's name, county recording reference number, principal office address.

**Document Types:**
- **Bylaws:** Rules for corporate governance.
- **CC&Rs:** Covenants, Conditions & Restrictions (Land use).
- **Articles of Incorporation:** Proving the HOA is a legal entity.
- **Plat Map:** (Linked hash) for legal boundary descriptions.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`skylinetowers-hoa.com`, `associa.com`) and current document status.

**Status Indications:**
- **In Force** — This is the current, legally binding version of the bylaws.
- **Superseded** — **ALERT:** A newer version has been adopted; this version is void.
- **Proposed** — Draft version under member review; not yet binding.
- **Archival** — Historical version for research only.

## Second-Party Use

The **Homeowner (Member)** benefits from verification.

**Governance Defense:** Proving to the Board that the rule they are enforcing (e.g., "No blue front doors") isn't actually in the **Verified Current Bylaws**. Verification prevents "Rogue Board Members" from fabricating or misrepresenting the rules during a dispute.

**Refinancing:** Providing verified governing documents to a lender's legal department. Lenders often delay closings for weeks because of "Incomplete" or "Unsigned" HOA packets; a verified hash from the HOA domain removes this barrier.

## Third-Party Use

**Real Estate Attorneys / Title Companies**
**Title Clearance:** Ensuring that the buyer is receiving the **absolute latest version** of the CC&Rs. Title companies currently spend thousands of hours manually checking county records; OCR-to-hash allows for instant, document-level verification.

**Mortgage Underwriters**
**Risk Management:** Verifying the "Rental Restrictions" or "Assessment Triggers" in the bylaws before approving a high-value condo loan.

**Property Management Firms**
**Transition Integrity:** When a new management firm takes over a building, they use verified hashes to ensure the "Digital Archive" they received from the previous firm hasn't been tampered with or corrupted.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Quiet Rule" Fraud Problem**

- **Selective Omission:** A seller "deleting" the page of the bylaws that mentions a $50,000 special assessment to trick a buyer into closing the deal.
- **Version Skew:** A Board member using an old 2015 version of the pet rules to target a neighbor with a dog, while the 2026 version allows pets.
- **Fabricated Signatures:** Forging the Secretary's signature on a rule change that was never actually voted on by the members.

**Issuer Types**

**Property Management Firms:** (Associa, FirstService, JLL).
**HOA Secretary / Boards.**
**Legal Data Platforms:** (e.g., HomeWiseDocs, CondoCerts).

## Competition vs. Private Portals

| Feature | OCR-to-Hash | Resident Portal (Associa) | Scanned PDF / Email |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Bound to the HOA. | **System-Bound.** Trust the portal vendor. | **Zero.** Easily forged. |
| **User Access** | **Universal.** Share with any buyer/lawyer. | **Restricted.** Third parties never get logins. | **Universal.** |
| **Integrity** | **Binds Content.** Protects the fine-print. | **Vulnerable.** Portal can be "Cleaned up" by admins. | **Zero.** |
| **Persistence** | **High.** Remains verifiable after sale. | **Low.** Access cut off after move-out. | **Vulnerable.** |

**Why OCR wins here:** The "External Trust" problem. HOA portals are private silos for current residents. But most verification happens for **Non-Residents** (Buyers, Banks, Title Co). OCR-to-hash turns the **Private Governing Document** into a portable, cryptographically trusted artifact that bridges the gap between the building and the market.
