## Data Verified

Full name, date of birth, residential address, unique ID number, sex, physical descriptors (Height/Eye Color), photo (via hash), document serial number, issuing authority, effective/expiration dates.

**Document Types:**
- **State/Provincial ID:** For non-drivers.
- **National ID Card:** Standard in many countries (e.g., EU, Singapore).
- **Public Service Card:** Proving eligibility for welfare/health services.
- **Tribal ID:** Issued by sovereign indigenous nations.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`mto.gov.on.ca`, `gov.uk`, `singpass.gov.sg`) and current identity standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Valid** — Identity is verified and current in the government registry.
- **Stolen/Lost** — **ALERT:** Bearer has reported this physical card missing.
- **Superseded** — A newer ID card version exists for this person.
- **Revoked** — Identity credentials terminated (e.g., due to fraud discovery).

## Second-Party Use

The **Named Individual** benefits from verification.

**Age Verification:** Proving to a bouncer or retailer that their "July 20, 1985" birthdate isn't a "Fake ID" modification. Verification against the government domain removes the merchant's fear of "Underage Sales" fines.

**KYC Onboarding:** Proving their identity to an online bank or crypto exchange without needing to wait for a 24-hour "Manual Review" of a high-res photo. A verified hash allows for instant, cryptographic trust.

## Third-Party Use

**Hospitality / Alcohol Retailers**
**Bouncer Efficiency:** Instantly confirming that a "Novice Fake" ID isn't authentic. Standard fakes look perfect to the eye; OCR-to-hash connects the bouncer directly to the government source in seconds.

**Landlords / Property Managers**
**Identity Vetting:** Ensuring that a rental applicant is exactly who they claim to be, reducing "Synthetic Identity" fraud in the housing market.

**Financial Institutions**
**Digital KYC:** Verifying the authenticity of a government ID during remote account opening, satisfying AML/CDD requirements without hardware scanners.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Fake ID" Fraud Problem**

- **Birthdate Tampering:** Minors using high-end printers to change their birth year on a valid ID to buy alcohol or enter venues.
- **Identity Theft:** Using a stolen ID but editing the name or photo on the card.
- **Status Faking:** Presenting a "Valid" paper ID for an identity that has been "Revoked" or "Flagged" by the government for fraud.

**Issuer Types**

**National Ministries of Interior:** (e.g., in Germany, Spain, Singapore).
**State/Provincial Governments:** (e.g., Ontario, California, Texas).
**Tribal Authorities.**

**Privacy Salt:** ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL. National identity data is the most sensitive data a government holds. The hash MUST be salted to prevent "Mass Mapping" of the population by hackers or foreign intelligence.

## Photo Return: Defeating Sibling Lending and High-Grade Clones

Verification responses can include the **issuer's authoritative photo** of the credential holder — not just "valid/invalid" but the actual face on file.

**Why This Matters:**

| Attack | Without Photo Return | With Photo Return |
|--------|---------------------|-------------------|
| **Sibling lending** | Bouncer squints at blurry card photo, waves through | Verification returns DMV's crisp photo — clear mismatch to person presenting |
| **High-grade clone** | Fake card with swapped photo, text hashes correctly | Text verifies, but returned photo doesn't match the face on the cloned card |

The cloner can perfectly replicate the card's text and even its holographic features. But they **cannot forge what the server sends back**. When the bouncer's phone displays the government's photo and it doesn't match the person in front of them, the fraud is exposed.

**The Doppelganger Attack (The "Woman in Cabin 10" Problem)**

Sophisticated fraudsters don't just clone cards — they search social media for facial lookalikes, recruit a doppelganger, then steal the victim's card details. The clone card shows the doppelganger's (similar) face, and when verified, the returned photo is "close enough" to pass casual inspection.

*This attack — finding lookalikes via social media facial matching — was dramatized in "The Woman in Cabin 10" (2025), where antagonists recruited a doppelganger to impersonate a billionaire.*

**Countermeasure: Geo-Anomaly Detection**

States can monitor verification request patterns:
- Card verified in London at 10am, then Los Angeles at 11am? Flagged.
- Card verified 50 times in one day across different venues? Flagged.
- Card verified in a jurisdiction 1,000 miles from holder's registered address repeatedly? Flagged.

Geo-checking won't stop a single clone use, but it detects systematic abuse and can trigger card revocation and investigation before major fraud occurs.

## Competition vs. NFC Chip Readers

| Feature | OCR-to-Hash | NFC (eID / Chip) | Scanned PDF / Image |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Integrity** | **Cryptographic.** Binds photo to status. | **High.** Binds digital keys. | **Zero.** Easily forged. |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Bound to the Gov. | **Key-Bound.** Trust the PKI. | **Visual.** |
| **Hardware** | **Universal.** Any smartphone camera. | **Restricted.** Requires NFC-enabled phones. |
| **Adoption** | **High.** Works for cards without chips. | **Low.** Many US/Canada IDs lack chips. |

**Why OCR wins here:** The "Technology Gap." While high-end EU IDs have NFC chips, many state and provincial IDs in North America are still just "Smart Paper." OCR-to-hash turn these **Low-Tech Cards** into live digital credentials, providing "Chip-Level" trust to billions of people without the cost of a hardware upgrade.
