## Verification Architecture

**The Broker-dealer licenses and registrations Fraud Problem**

Document fraud creates significant risks:

- **Fabrication:** Entirely fake documents created from scratch
- **Alteration:** Genuine documents with modified content (dates, amounts, names)
- **Impersonation:** Documents falsely claiming to be from legitimate issuers
- **Expired/Revoked Documents:** Presenting invalid documents as current
- **Permit Sharing:** Using one property's permit for work at another location
- **Scope Expansion:** Expanding permitted activities beyond authorization
- **Contractor Fraud:** Claiming permits that were never obtained

OCR-to-hash verification addresses fake and altered documents. Domain binding confirms the claimed issuer actually issued the document.

**Banks and Credit Unions:** Depository institutions for account documents.

**Investment Firms:** Brokerage and investment management firms.

**Insurance Companies:** Insurers for policy and claims documents.

**Accounting Firms:** CPAs and audit firms for financial statements.

**System Integration**

Verification integrates with relevant systems:

**Issuer Systems:** Core operational systems generate verification hashes at document creation.

**Industry Standards:** Existing data standards extended to include verification.

**Regulatory Systems:** Government databases for systematic hash receipt and oversight.

**Third-Party Platforms:** Industry portals and platforms enable verification access.

BrokerCheck integration for public lookup. Wallet card format for client meetings. Critical for investor protection where broker credential verification prevents fraud by barred individuals.
