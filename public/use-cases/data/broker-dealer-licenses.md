## Data Verified

Representative name, CRD (Central Registration Depository) number, current firm affiliation, registration status (Active/Suspended/Barred), examination history (Series 7, 63, 24), disciplinary disclosures flag, date of issuance.

**Document Types:**
- **Registration Certificate:** Wall-hung proof of firm registration.
- **Representative ID Card:** For face-to-face client meetings.
- **Disciplinary Summary:** Detailed list of past "Regulator Alerts."

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`finra.org`, `sec.gov`) and current regulatory standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Registered** — Individual is authorized to sell securities.
- **Barred** — Permanently prohibited from the industry.
- **Suspended** — Temporarily prohibited (dates provided).
- **Inactive** — Not currently affiliated with a firm.

## Second-Party Use

The **Broker / Representative** benefits from verification.

**Client Trust:** Proving to a potential high-net-worth investor that they are a "Verified Registered Rep" and not an impostor. The client can scan the badge during an initial meeting to see the "Active" status directly from FINRA.

**License Portability:** Speeding up the onboarding process when moving to a new firm by providing a verified record of their exams and clean disciplinary history.

## Third-Party Use

**Retail Investors (Consumers)**
**Fraud Prevention:** Before handing over a life-savings check, an investor can verify the broker's credentials. This stops "affinity fraud" where scammers pose as brokers to target specific communities.

**Compliance Departments**
**Due Diligence:** Recruiting teams at major firms (e.g., Morgan Stanley, Merrill) can instantly verify the "Series 7" claims of a new hire by scanning their previous registration certificate.

**Lenders / Banks**
**Authorized Signers:** Verifying that the person signing a corporate brokerage resolution has the regulatory authority to do so.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Barred Broker" Fraud Problem**

- **Ghost Credentials:** A broker who was barred for stealing client funds continuing to use their old, unexpired "Registration Certificate" to lure in new victims.
- **Firm Impersonation:** Using the name of a real, famous firm (e.g., Goldman Sachs) on a fake certificate to legitimize a Ponzi scheme.
- **Disciplinary Hiding:** Editing a PDF summary to remove "Customer Complaints" or "Regulatory Fines."

**Issuer Types**

**FINRA:** (The primary self-regulatory organization).
**SEC:** (Federal oversight).
**State Securities Regulators:** (e.g., NASAA members).

## Competition vs. FINRA BrokerCheck (Search)

| Feature | OCR-to-Hash | BrokerCheck Website | Paper Certificate |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Integrity** | **Binds Identity.** Proves *this* person is the one. | **Live.** Shows status *today*. | **Static.** Easily forged. |
| **User Experience** | **Seamless.** Scan the badge/paper. | **Hard.** Ask for CRD #, type it, find the right name. | **Manual.** |
| **Trust** | **Domain-Bound.** Bound to `finra.org`. | **High.** Direct DB access. | **Medium.** |
| **Disclosures** | **Active Alert.** Can highlight a BARRED status in red. | **Deep.** Requires reading long PDF reports. | **Hidden.** |

**Why OCR wins here:** The "Meeting Moment." Investors are often too polite or embarrassed to ask for a broker's CRD number and look them up on a laptop during a meeting. OCR-to-hash turns the broker's business card or wall certificate into a **low-friction trust anchor** that the client can scan discreetly.
