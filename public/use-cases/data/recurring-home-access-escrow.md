## What is Recurring Home Access Identity Escrow?

When you hire someone through informal channels (Nextdoor, Facebook groups, word of mouth) for recurring access to your home, you're trusting a stranger with:
- Keys to your house
- Access when you're not there
- Contact with vulnerable family members (children, elderly, pets)

Unlike agency-placed workers, there's no organizational accountability. If something goes wrong after month six, you might only have a first name and a phone number that stops working.

This is **ongoing identity escrow for informal recurring relationships**—verified identity held by a third party for the duration of the arrangement, with accountability if problems emerge.

## Derivation 1: Weekly House Cleaner

**The Problem:**
You find a cleaner on Nextdoor. She seems great. You give her keys. She comes every Tuesday for eight months. Then jewelry goes missing. You have "Maria" and a phone number—which is now disconnected.

| No reputation | Agency reputation only | Individual reputation |
| Full market rate to worker | Agency takes 30-50% cut | Full rate to worker, small escrow fee |

## Derivation 2: Regular Dog Walker

**The Problem:**
Your dog walker has keys and knows your schedule (when you're definitely not home). This is valuable information for burglary. If they're using a fake identity, you have no recourse.

**How Recurring Identity Escrow Helps:**

Same pattern as house cleaner, with pet-specific additions:

## Derivation 3: Recurring Babysitter

**The Problem:**
You hire a college student to babysit every Saturday night. After three months, you trust her completely. But your reference was "my neighbor's friend's daughter." If something happened to your child, could you find her?

**How Recurring Identity Escrow Helps:**

<div style="max-width: 650px; margin: 24px auto; border: 1px solid #ccc; background: #fff; padding: 20px; box-shadow: 0 4px 10px rgba(0,0,0,0.05);">

## Derivation 4: Elder Care Aide

**The Problem:**
Your aging parent needs help a few hours a day. A full-time agency aide is expensive and inflexible. You find someone through a community group. But your parent is vulnerable—cognitively declining, physically frail, has valuables and medications in the home.

**How Recurring Identity Escrow Helps:**

<div style="max-width: 650px; margin: 24px auto; border: 1px solid #ccc; background: #fff; padding: 20px; box-shadow: 0 4px 10px rgba(0,0,0,0.05);">

## Verification Architecture

**Recurring vs. One-Time Escrow:**

This is the recurring counterpart to ad-hoc identity escrow. See `peer-to-peer-sale-witnessing.md` for one-time transactions.

| Aspect | One-Time (P2P Sale) | Recurring (Home Access) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Duration | Single transaction | Ongoing relationship |
| Escrow lifecycle | Ends after sale | Duration + buffer period |
| Reputation | None (one-off) | Accumulates over time |
| Disclosure triggers | Incident-based | Pattern-based alerts possible |
| Key differentiator | "Can I find them if this laptop is stolen?" | "Can I find them after 6 months of service?" |

**The Value of Accumulated History:**

A provider with "312 verified walks, no incidents" is meaningfully different from a new provider. Identity escrow enables this reputation to:
- Transfer across clients (anonymized)
- Survive platform changes
- Serve as portable credential

**Contact Relay Benefits:**

Neither party needs the other's personal phone/email:
- Messages through platform
- Schedule changes logged
- No harassment if relationship ends
- Provider can block problematic clients

**Two-Way Accountability:**

The client is also escrowed:
- Provider can report abusive clients
- Pattern of non-payment flagged
- Unsafe home conditions documented
- Provider has recourse too

## Jurisdictional Considerations

**Labor Law Intersection:**
- Identity escrow doesn't create employment relationship
- Workers remain independent contractors
- Tax reporting (1099) is separate concern
- Some jurisdictions may regulate domestic worker platforms

**Background Check Regulations:**
- FCRA compliance for formal background checks
- Ban-the-box laws in some jurisdictions
- Consent required for checks

**Insurance:**
- Identity escrow doesn't provide liability coverage
- Workers may need own insurance
- Homeowner policy may cover some incidents

**Public Blockchain (Non-Party)**

Witnessing firms may periodically commit rollups to a public blockchain, providing:
- Proof of service history at specific times
- Portable reputation if escrow provider fails
- Tamper-evidence for dispute resolution
