## What is Medical Implant & Procedure Witnessing?

Medical work is often concealed by the body itself. A hip implant, a root canal, a surgical mesh—once the incision closes or the crown is placed, the work is invisible. Problems emerge years or decades later:

- Metal-on-metal hip: cobalt poisoning, 8 years post-surgery
- Dental crown: decay underneath, 5 years later
- Hernia mesh: erosion, chronic pain, 3-7 years
- Breast implant: rupture, capsular contracture, 10+ years

**The attribution problem:** By the time symptoms appear, the surgeon may have retired, the dental practice sold, the manufacturer bankrupt. Records may be incomplete or lost.

**The insurance driver:** Medical malpractice insurers and product liability carriers want attribution. If claims can be traced to specific procedures, specific devices, specific practitioners—pricing improves, bad actors are identified, defensible claims are paid faster.

## Derivation 1: Orthopedic Implants (Hip, Knee, Shoulder)

**The Concealment:**
- Implant placed inside joint
- Incision closed
- Only visible via imaging after that

**The Delayed Discovery:**
- Metal-on-metal hip failures: 5-15 years (DePuy ASR recall)
- Polyethylene wear: 10-20 years
- Implant loosening: 10-25 years
- Metallosis (metal poisoning): 5-10 years

**Why This Matters:**

| Scenario | Without Attestation | With Attestation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Recall issued year 8 | "Which patients have this lot?" Uncertain | Lot-level traceability |
| Revision needed year 12 | "What's in there?" May need imaging | Exact implant spec on file |
| Malpractice claim | "Was it positioned correctly?" No evidence | Intraop photos available |
| Product liability | "Defective device or surgical error?" Hard to distinguish | Evidence separates device from technique |

## Derivation 2: Dental Work (Crowns, Root Canals, Implants)

**The Concealment:**
- Crown covers underlying tooth structure
- Root canal fills canals invisibly
- Implant buried in bone

**The Delayed Discovery:**
- Decay under crown: 3-10 years
- Failed root canal: 2-10 years (persistent infection)
- Implant failure: 5-15 years
- Poor crown margins: years of gum recession

**What Gets Witnessed:**

</div>

**The Dental-Specific Problem:**

Dentistry has particularly poor attribution because:
- Patients change dentists frequently
- Records often don't transfer completely
- "Who did this crown?" often unknown
- Subsequent dentist may blame predecessor

**Insurance Driver:**
- Dental malpractice claims often turn on "was the work substandard or did the patient not follow care instructions?"
- Photo evidence at time of placement resolves this

---

## Derivation 3: Surgical Mesh (Hernia, Pelvic)

**The Concealment:**
- Mesh placed inside body cavity
- Tissue grows into/around mesh
- Completely invisible externally

**The Delayed Discovery:**
- Mesh erosion: 2-10 years
- Chronic pain: months to years
- Mesh contraction: years
- Organ perforation: variable

**The Mass Tort Problem:**

Pelvic mesh litigation became one of the largest mass torts in history. Attribution challenges:
- Which manufacturer's mesh?
- Which lot?
- Surgical technique vs. product defect?
- When did symptoms actually begin?

**What Gets Witnessed:**

- Mesh product identification (lot, size, manufacturer)
- Placement technique (photos/video where appropriate)
- Tension settings
- Fixation method
- Intraoperative findings

**Insurance/Legal Value:**

| Party | Benefit of Attestation |
| :--- | :--- |
| Patient | Clear record for any future claim |
| Surgeon | Defense against technique allegations |
| Manufacturer | Distinguish product defect from misuse |
| Insurer | Faster claim resolution, better pricing |

## Derivation 4: Breast Implants

**The Concealment:**
- Implant placed under tissue/muscle
- Incision heals
- Only visible via imaging

**The Delayed Discovery:**
- Rupture: 10-20 years (or earlier for defective devices)
- Capsular contracture: 2-10+ years
- BIA-ALCL (cancer): years to decades
- Breast implant illness (contested): variable

**Recall History:**

Multiple recalls over decades:
- Silicone gel moratorium (1992-2006)
- PIP implants (2010 - fraudulent silicone)
- Textured implant ALCL risk (2019)

**What Gets Witnessed:**

</div>

**Why Lot-Level Tracking Matters:**

When recalls happen, patients need to know:
- Do I have the affected product?
- Which lot?
- Should I get imaging/explant?

Without attestation, patients may not know what's in their body.

## The Insurance Enforcement Model

**How Insurance Drives Adoption:**

```
Patients want coverage for claims 20 years out
              ↓
Malpractice/product liability insurers need attribution
              ↓
Insurers mandate attestation as condition of coverage
              ↓
Providers must use approved witness/registry systems
              ↓
Work gets documented at time of procedure
              ↓
Claims 20 years later are attributable
```

**Premium Incentives:**
- Full attestation = lower malpractice premiums
- Device registry participation = manufacturer rebates
- Photo documentation = faster claim resolution

**The Bag Carrier's Protection:**

The patient is the ultimate bag carrier. Attestation protects them:
- Know what's in their body (device ID, lot)
- Evidence if something goes wrong
- Attribution if manufacturer/provider is negligent
- Transferable record if they change providers

---

## Device Registry Integration

**National/International Registries:**
- National Joint Registry (UK) - hips, knees
- AJRR (US) - American Joint Replacement Registry
- FDA MAUDE - device adverse events
- Breast Implant Registry (Australia, UK)

**Attestation + Registry:**
- Attestation = detailed procedure record
- Registry = population-level tracking
- Together = individual attribution + pattern detection

---

## Jurisdictional Considerations

**US:**
- FDA device tracking requirements (some devices)
- HIPAA protection for patient records
- State medical board licensing
- Statute of limitations varies by state (discovery rule)

**UK:**
- MHRA device regulation
- NHS records retention
- National registries (NJR, etc.)
- Clinical Negligence Scheme for Trusts

**EU:**
- MDR (Medical Device Regulation) - UDI requirements
- Implant cards mandatory for patients
- GDPR for patient data

## Concealment vs. Attribution Timeline

| Procedure | Concealed By | Discovery Delay | Attribution Window |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Hip replacement | Incision closure | 5-20 years | Lifetime |
| Dental crown | Crown placement | 3-10 years | Patient lifetime |
| Hernia mesh | Tissue closure | 2-10 years | Lifetime |
| Breast implant | Incision closure | 10-30+ years | Lifetime |
| Root canal | Filling, crown | 2-10 years | Patient lifetime |

## Public Blockchain (Non-Party)

Witnessing services may commit procedure attestation hashes to a public blockchain, providing:
- Proof that records existed at specific times
- Independence from provider record-keeping
- Survival beyond practice closure, retirement
- Patient-controlled access to their own attestations
- Long-term verification (decades) beyond any single system

## Future: Technology Evolution

Witnessing technology will advance far beyond photos and text attestations—AI analysis of surgical video, smart implants with embedded sensors, continuous monitoring throughout device lifetime. Insurance requirements will drive adoption.

See `construction-trade-witnessing.md` → "Future: Witnessing Technology Evolution" for detailed analysis of the technology trajectory and insurance-legislation feedback loop. The same dynamics apply to medical witnessing: insurers mandate → technology develops → costs drop → requirements increase.
