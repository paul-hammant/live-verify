## What are UST Compliance Certificates?

An **Underground Storage Tank (UST)** certificate is the "Environmental Passport" for a gas station or industrial site. These tanks hold thousands of gallons of toxic fuel or chemicals. If they leak, they can contaminate local groundwater and cost millions in cleanup fees. State and federal law (EPA 40 CFR 280) requires regular, certified inspections of leak detection systems and corrosion protection.

These documents are high-stakes environmental proofs. Fraud is common: owners often "edit" a failed leak test into a "PASS" to avoid the $50,000 cost of a tank replacement. Similarly, shady inspectors might "pencil whip" a report for a site they never visited. Verified hashes bind the **Facility ID, Tank Serial Numbers, and Leak Test Results** to the state's or the inspector's domain (e.g., `epa.gov` or `state-environment.gov`).

## Data Verified

EPA Facility ID, owner/operator name, facility address, tank counts and IDs, tank capacity/contents, leak detection method (e.g., SIR, ATG), test results (pass/fail/inconclusive), cathodic protection status, inspector name/license, expiration date.

**Document Types:**
- **Annual Compliance Certificate:** The primary proof of safety.
- **Tightness Test Report:** Results from a high-pressure integrity test.
- **Release Response Plan:** (Linked hash) proving spill preparedness.
- **Closure Certificate:** Proof a tank was safely decommissioned.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`epa.gov`, `state-ust-registry.org`, `ecy.wa.gov`) and the tank standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Compliant / Pass** — Facility is in full environmental compliance.
- **Failure Detected** — **CRITICAL:** A leak or system failure has been recorded.
- **Expired** — Mandatory inspection window has passed; facility is illegal.
- **Quarantined** — **ALERT:** Active investigation into potential groundwater contamination.

## Second-Party Use

The **Gas Station Owner / Operator** benefits from verification.

**Lease Renewal:** Proving to a property owner or a master-franchisor (e.g., Shell, BP) that the site is environmentally safe. A verified hash removes the risk of "Environmental Default" on the lease, protecting the operator's business.

**Mortgage Refinancing:** When refinancing a gas station property, the bank's underwriter scans the verified UST certificate. "Verified by EPA" ensures the bank that they aren't lending against a "Superfund Site" liability.

## Third-Party Use

**Environmental Inspectors / Field Agents**
**Surprise Audit:** Instead of digging through a binder of un-ordered papers, the agent scans the placard in the office. OCR-to-hash ensures the papers in the file match the digital record, stopping "Log Doctoring" where owners hide failed test results.

**Environmental Insurers**
**Claims Adjudication:** If a leak is discovered, the insurer verifies the history of verified certificates. If the hash returns **"EXPIRED"** or **"NOT FOUND"** for the last 3 cycles, the insurer may deny the claim for failure to maintain safety equipment.

**Prospective Buyers**
**Due Diligence:** A buyer can scan the verified compliance history of a gas station before signing a contract, protecting them from a multi-million dollar "Legacy Leak" cleanup.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Phantom Pass" Fraud Problem**

- **Leak Masking:** Editing an "Inconclusive" or "Fail" test result to read "PASS" on a PDF report.
- **Date Stretching:** Using an expired 2024 certificate for a 2026 inspection cycle.
- **Inspector Impersonation:** Creating fake reports from an inspector who was never at the site.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**State Environmental Agencies.**
**National Registry Bodies (EPA).**
**Certified Environmental Audit Firms.**

**Privacy Salt:** Low. UST compliance is generally public environmental record. However, individual inspector license numbers should be salted to protect professional privacy.

## Rationale

UST safety is about "Unseen Risk." By turning compliance certificates into verifiable digital bridges, we create a transparent "Barrier of Trust" that ensures the tanks under our feet are as safe as the paper on the wall claims.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing

A jurisdiction may require the issuer to retain a **witnessing firm** for regulatory compliance. The witnessing firm:

- Receives all hashes from the issuer, and any subsequent changes to the payload as they happen—which may manifest as a new hash, a status change, or even a 404 (record deleted)
- Receives structured content/metadata (key identifiers and dates)
- Does **NOT** receive plaintext or sensitive personal information
- Provides an immutable, timestamped audit trail—available to the jurisdiction on demand, to document holders/third parties during disputes, or as expert witness testimony in legal proceedings

This provides:
- **Non-repudiation:** Issuer cannot deny issuing the document
- **Timestamp proof:** Document existed at a specific time
- **Regulatory audit:** Jurisdictions can inspect the witness ledger for fraud detection
- **Resilience:** Verification works even if issuer's systems go down

**Public Blockchain (Non-Party)**

Witnessing firms may periodically commit rollups to an inexpensive public blockchain, providing an ultimate immutability guarantee. The blockchain is a "non-party"—infrastructure, not a participant in the transaction. This creates multiple verification paths:

1. **Issuer domain** — Direct check against the issuer
2. **Witnessing firm** — Independent confirmation with timestamp
3. **Public blockchain** — Decentralized trust anchor via rollup inclusion
