## What is a Property Appraisal?

A **Property Appraisal** is the professional "Opinion of Value" for a piece of real estate. For residential homes, this is documented in the **Uniform Residential Appraisal Report (URAR)**. It is the "Anchor of Collateral" for the multi-trillion dollar mortgage market.

Because the appraisal determines how much money a bank will lend, it is a primary target for **Valuation Fraud**. Shady owners or "Fix-and-Flip" scammers often "edit" an appraisal to turn a $400,000 value into a $600,000 one to bypass equity requirements. Similarly, they might use a fake "Certified" letter from a non-existent appraiser. Verified hashes bind the **Final Opinion of Value, Property Condition, and Appraiser License** to the appraisal firm's or the state's domain (e.g., `corelogic.com` or `state-appraisal-board.gov`).

## Data Verified

Appraisal reference number, property address, appraiser name/license, opinion of value (numerical and text), effective date of valuation, overall property condition rating (e.g., C1-C6), square footage, year built, client name, AMC (Appraisal Management Company) ID.

**Document Types:**
- **URAR (Form 1004):** The primary residential summary.
- **Appraisal Update (Form 1004D):** Proof that value hasn't changed.
- **Desktop Valuation:** A faster, non-inspection evaluation.
- **BPO (Broker Price Opinion):** A less formal realtor-led valuation.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`corelogic.com`, `veros.com`, `summit-eval.com`) and the valuation standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Verified / Current** — Valuation matches the appraiser's original digital record.
- **Value Mismatch** — **CRITICAL:** The amount on the paper has been altered from the original finding.
- **Expired** — **ALERT:** Appraisal is more than 6 months old; a re-certification is required.
- **Redlined** — **ALERT:** The property is in a restricted or high-risk zone (e.g., flood/fire).

## Second-Party Use

The **Homeowner / Seller** benefits from verification.

**Sales Price Justification:** A homeowner selling their house can show the verified "Appraisal Hash" to a potential buyer. The buyer scans it and sees **"VERIFIED VALUE: $545,000"** from a certified appraiser. This removes the doubt that the seller is "Exaggerating" the home's value, potentially closing the sale faster.

**Tax Appeal Evidence:** If a property tax assessor over-values a home, the owner can provide the verified hash of a recent professional appraisal to prove the "Fair Market Value" with cryptographic certainty, winning the appeal without a hearing.

## Third-Party Use

**Mortgage Lenders / Underwriters**
**Zero-Trust Collateral Vetting:** Thousands of "Edited" appraisals are submitted to banks every year. OCR-to-hash connects the underwriter directly to the appraisal firm's domain, stopping "Equity Siphoning" fraud at the source and protecting the bank's loan-to-value (LTV) ratios.

**Real Estate Secondary Markets (Fannie/Freddie)**
**Quality Control Audit:** Instantly verifying thousands of appraisal files in a mortgage-backed security (MBS). OCR-to-hash ensures the underlying valuations are authentic and haven't been "Padded" to increase the bond's value.

**State Appraisal Boards**
**Disciplinary Audit:** Verifying that a specific "Opinion of Value" was actually signed by the licensed appraiser claimed on the paper, stopping the "Clone License" fraud used by unlicensed workers.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Kitchen Renovation" Fraud Problem**

- **Value Padding:** Changing a $400,000 value to $450,000 on a PDF to qualify for a home equity line of credit (HELOC).
- **Condition Inflation:** Editing a "C4" (Fair) condition rating into a "C2" (Excellent) to hide deferred maintenance.
- **Appraiser Spoofing:** Creating a fake report using a reputable appraiser's name and license number from a public registry.

**Issuer Types**

**Appraisal Management Companies (AMCs).**
**Large National Appraisal Firms.**
**State Real Estate Commissions.**

**Privacy Salt:** Essential. Home values and floor plans are sensitive private data. The hash must be salted to prevent "Wealth Mapping" of entire neighborhoods by data scrapers.

## Rationale

Property value is the "Foundation of Credit." By turning static appraisal reports into verifiable digital bridges, we protect the stability of the housing market and ensure that the "Wealth" on the page is backed by the professional truth of the audit.
