## Verification Architecture

**The Industry certifications (IT, finance, construction) Fraud Problem**

Document fraud creates significant risks:

- **Fabrication:** Entirely fake documents created from scratch
- **Alteration:** Genuine documents with modified content (dates, amounts, names)
- **Impersonation:** Documents falsely claiming to be from legitimate issuers
- **Expired/Revoked Documents:** Presenting invalid documents as current

OCR-to-hash verification addresses fake and altered documents. Domain binding confirms the claimed issuer actually issued the document.

**Issuer Types**

Who issues these documents and operates verification endpoints?

**Government Entities:** Counties, cities, and special districts maintain property records.

**Title Companies:** Title insurers and escrow companies for transaction documents.

**Lending Institutions:** Banks and mortgage companies for loan documents.

**Appraisal Firms:** Licensed appraisers for property valuations.

**System Integration**

Real estate verification connects to property systems:

**Recording Systems:** County recorder systems for property document registration.

**MLS Integration:** Multiple listing services for property documentation.

**Title Plants:** Title companies maintain verification for title searches.

**E-Recording:** Electronic recording systems generate verification at recording.

## Rationale

Similar to professional license and CV credentials use case. Professional appearance for resumes and LinkedIn profiles. Prevents fake IT certifications (like fake AWS, Cisco, PMP credentials). Domain binding to certification bodies (CompTIA, PMI, CFA Institute, etc.). Employers verify credentials without calling certification body.
