## Data Verified

Certified individual name, certification title (e.g., PMP, CISSP, AWS Architect), unique credential ID, issuing organization name, specialization/domain, effective date, expiration date, PDU (Professional Development Unit) status.

**Document Types:**
- **Professional Certificate:** The formal "Wall Diploma."
- **Wallet Card:** For field-access requirements (e.g., OSHA 30).
- **Exam Score Report:** (Linked hash) for recent test results.
- **Badge Metadata:** For digital badges (with OCR-to-hash back-link).

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`pmi.org`, `isc2.org`, `amazon.com`) and current credential standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Active** — Bearer has met all requirements and is in good standing.
- **Suspended** — Disciplinary action or ethics violation found.
- **Expired** — Mandatory renewal or continuing education (PDUs) missed.
- **Retired** — Credential version no longer supported.

## Second-Party Use

The **Certified Professional** benefits from verification.

**Resume Integrity:** Proving to a recruiter that the "PMP" or "CISSP" listed on their resume is verified by the source. This distinguishes the professional from the "Resume Padders" who claim certifications they never actually earned or let lapse years ago.

**Social Media Proof:** Posting a verified "AWS Certified" hash on a LinkedIn profile. Unlike a static image, the hash allows hiring managers to verify the credential without leaving the platform.

**Project Bidding:** Including verified hashes of all team member certifications in a high-stakes government or corporate RFP.

## Third-Party Use

**Hiring Managers / Recruiters**
**Instant Vetting:** Scanning the certificates of 50+ candidates in minutes. OCR-to-hash allows an applicant tracking system (ATS) to automatically validate credentials against the issuing organization's domain, stopping "Credential Forgery" at the scale of the entire hiring pipeline.

**State / Federal Regulators**
**Contract Compliance:** Verifying that the lead engineer on a public works project actually holds the mandatory "PE" or "OSHA 30" verified certifications required by the contract.

**Training Providers**
**Prerequisite Proof:** Verifying that a student has passed the "Basic" level certification before allowing them to enroll in an "Advanced" course.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Credential Mill" Fraud Problem**

- **Certificate Forgery:** Scammers creating fake certificates from reputable organizations (e.g., Cisco or Microsoft) for people who didn't pass the exam.
- **Status Faking:** Changing an "Expired" date to "Active" on a PDF to keep a job that requires current certification.
- **Identity Theft:** Using a real person's credential ID but editing the name on the certificate.

**Issuer Types**

**Professional Associations:** (PMI, CFA Institute, (ISC)², ISACA).
**Tech Vendors:** (Amazon/AWS, Microsoft, Google, Cisco).
**Safety Organizations:** (OSHA, Red Cross).

## Competition vs. Digital Badges (Credly)

| Feature | OCR-to-Hash | Digital Badges (Credly/Acclaim) | Scanned PDF |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Bound to the Org (PMI). | **System-Bound.** Trust the badge vendor. | **Zero.** Easily forged. |
| **Interoperability** | **Universal.** Works across any cert body. | **Low.** Only for bodies who pay for Credly. | **Universal.** |
| **Integrity** | **Binds Content.** Protects the ID #. | **High.** Direct digital link. | **Vulnerable.** |
| **Hardware** | **Universal.** Any smartphone camera. | **Technical.** Requires app/portal access. | **Visual.** |

**Why OCR wins here:** The "Paper Wall." Most high-end certifications are still issued as high-quality paper diplomas or PDFs. While digital badges are growing, they don't help in a face-to-face interview or a project bid binder. OCR-to-hash turn the **Static Certificate** into a live digital dashboard, bringing "Digital Badge" integrity to the world of paper.
