## What is a Discharge Summary?

When a patient leaves the hospital, they receive a **Discharge Summary**. This is the "User Manual" for their recovery.

It lists:
1.  **The Diagnosis:** "Why were you here?"
2.  **The Meds:** "What new drugs must you take starting today?"
3.  **The Plan:** "When is your next surgery?"

This paper is the #1 tool for preventing "Medical Errors" when a patient moves to a nursing home or goes back to their primary doctor. Verified summaries ensure that a patient (or a family member) doesn't accidentally "Edit" the medication list, which can be fatal.

## Data Verified

Patient name, MRN (Medical Record Number), admission/discharge dates, primary diagnosis, list of new medications (dose/frequency), follow-up requirements, attending physician name, facility ID.

**Document Types:**
- **Discharge Summary:** The formal medical history of the stay.
- **Discharge Instructions:** Patient-friendly "To-Do" list.
- **Medication Reconciliation:** List of what to take vs. what to stop.
- **Care Plan:** For home health or skilled nursing facilities.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`cedars-sinai.org`, `mayoclinic.org`) and the record standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Final** — Summary is complete and verified by the attending physician.
- **Amended** — A correction was issued (e.g., due to a medication change).
- **In-Progress** — Patient discharged but final summary pending.
- **Void** — Record assigned to wrong patient (rare safety event).

## Second-Party Use

The **Patient / Caregiver** benefits from verification.

**Safe Transitions:** Proving to a home-health nurse or a retail pharmacist that the "New Medications" on the paper aren't a typo or a misprint. A verified list reduces the chance of "Medication Errors," which are the #1 cause of hospital re-admissions.

**Personal Health Records:** Carrying a verified, cryptographically trusted "Source of Truth" about their hospital stay, which can be shared with future doctors anywhere in the world.

## Third-Party Use

**Skilled Nursing Facilities (SNFs)**
**Intake Integrity:** When a patient arrives from the hospital, the SNF nurse scans the discharge summary. "Verified by Cedars-Sinai" ensures the instructions weren't "Modified" by a family member to hide a contagious condition or a complex wound care requirement.

**Primary Care Physicians (PCPs)**
**Continuity of Care:** PCP offices often wait days for hospital faxes. OCR-to-hash allows them to instantly trust the paper instructions brought in by the patient at the 7-day follow-up visit.

**Health Insurers**
**Outcome Audits:** Verifying that the care plan was actually followed to determine if a re-admission was "Preventable" or not.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Paper Lag" Fraud Problem**

- **Medication Forgery:** Patients editing a discharge summary to add a prescription for an opioid or to remove a "No Driving" restriction.
- **Condition Concealment:** Deleting mention of "Alcohol Abuse" or "Psychiatric Consult" from a summary before sending it to a new employer or insurer.
- **Phantom Discharges:** Creating a fake summary to justify a 2-week absence from work.

**Issuer Types**

**Hospitals & Health Systems:** (Cedars-Sinai, Kaiser, HCA).
**EHR Vendors:** (Epic, Cerner - hosting the hashes on behalf of hospitals).
**Health Information Exchanges (HIEs).**

**Privacy Salt:** ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL. Medical data is highly sensitive (HIPAA/GDPR). The hash MUST be salted to prevent "Guess-and-Check" attacks to find specific patient diagnoses.

## Competition vs. Patient Portals / HIEs

| Feature | OCR-to-Hash | Patient Portal (Epic) | Health Info Exchange (HIE) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Bound to the Hospital. | **System-Bound.** Requires login. | **Network-Bound.** |
| **User Access** | **Instant.** Scan the paper in the clinic. | **Slow.** Requires patient to log in and share screen. | **Difficult.** Requires clinical integration. |
| **Integrity** | **Cryptographic.** Binds the *Text*. | **High.** Direct DB access. | **High.** |
| **Cross-System** | **Universal.** Works across any health system. | **Siloed.** Hard to share across different vendors. | **Limited.** Regional only. |

**Why OCR wins here:** The "Front Line" reality. Doctors in outpatient clinics don't have time to log into 10 different patient portals or wait for a regional HIE to sync. OCR-to-hash turns the **Physical Discharge Packet** (which the patient always has) into a live, trusted clinical link.
