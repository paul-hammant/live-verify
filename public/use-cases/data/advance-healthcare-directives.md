## Data Verified

Patient/principal name, date of birth, healthcare agent (proxy) name and contact information, alternate agents, specific medical treatment preferences, life-sustaining treatment wishes, organ donation preferences, witness names and signatures, notary name and commission number (where required), directive date, any revocations or amendments.

**Document Types:**
- **Living Will:** Written instructions for end-of-life care
- **Healthcare Power of Attorney:** Designates agent for medical decisions
- **Combined Directive:** Living will and healthcare POA together
- **Do Not Resuscitate (DNR) Orders:** Physician orders for resuscitation decisions
- **POLST/MOLST Forms:** Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment
- **Mental Health Directive:** Preferences for psychiatric treatment
- **Anatomical Gift Declaration:** Organ and tissue donation wishes

**Life-or-Death Verification:** These documents directly determine medical treatment in critical situations. Hospital verification before implementing life-sustaining treatment decisions is essential.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (registry, notary, or healthcare system) and the responder text.

**Status Indications:**
- **Valid** - Directive is current and in effect
- **Revoked** - Principal has revoked the directive
- **Superseded** - Replaced by newer directive
- **Expired** - Directive has time limitation that has passed

**Agent Confirmation:** Verification may confirm designated agent: "Valid - Healthcare agent: [name]."

## Verification Architecture

**The Advance Directive Fraud Problem**

Fraudulent directives can harm patients:

- **Forged Directives:** Fake documents overriding patient's true wishes
- **Altered Preferences:** Genuine directives with modified treatment choices
- **Unauthorized Agents:** False healthcare proxy designations
- **Revocation Fraud:** False claims that directive was revoked
- **Outdated Directives:** Superseded documents presented as current
- **Capacity Fraud:** Directives executed by incapacitated persons

OCR-to-hash addresses forgery and alteration. Registry verification confirms current status.

**Registries and Healthcare Systems as Issuers**

Multiple parties may verify directives:

**State Registries:** Official state advance directive registries.

**Healthcare Systems:** Hospital and health system databases.

**Attorney Records:** Law firms maintaining client directives.

**National Registries:** US Living Will Registry and similar services.

Each maintains verification endpoints for directives in their custody.

**Notarization:** Some states require or recommend notarization.

**Who Cannot Witness:** Restrictions on who can serve as witness.

**Healthcare Provider Witnesses:** Special rules for provider witnesses.

Verification confirms proper execution: "Verified - Two witnesses and notarized [date]."

Laws differ significantly:

**Form Requirements:** State-specific form requirements.

**Agent Authority:** What decisions agents can make.

**Default Surrogates:** Who decides without designated agent.

**Reciprocity:** Recognition of out-of-state directives.

Verification indicates governing law: "Verified under [state] law."

**POLST/MOLST Protocols**

**Portable Orders:** Travel with patient between care settings.

**Scope:** Addresses specific treatments (CPR, intubation, feeding tubes).

**Capacity Assessment:** May require physician determination.
