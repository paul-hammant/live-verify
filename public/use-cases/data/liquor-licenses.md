## Verification Architecture

**The Liquor License Fraud Problem**

License fraud enables illegal alcohol sales:

- **Wrong Type:** Off-premises license used for bar operation
- **Altered Conditions:** Restrictions removed from license copy
- **Transferred Without Approval:** Operating under previous owner's license
- **Scope Fraud:** Exceeding authorized hours or capacity

OCR-to-hash addresses forgery and alteration. ABC database verification confirms current status.

State agencies regulate alcohol:

**ABC Boards:** Alcoholic Beverage Control boards.

**Liquor Control Commissions:** Alternative state structures.

**Local Licensing:** Some cities have additional requirements.

**Three-Tier System:** Separation of manufacturer, distributor, retailer.

Each state agency operates verification endpoints for licenses they issue.

**Transfer and Sale Procedures**

Licenses require transfer approval:

**Application Process:** New owner must apply for transfer.

**Background Checks:** Transferee undergoes investigation.

**Creditor Claims:** Outstanding debts may block transfer.

**Approval Period:** Transfers take weeks to months.

Verification status should indicate: "Transfer pending to [new owner], effective [date]."

Many jurisdictions limit licenses:

**Population Quotas:** Licenses per capita.

**Geographic Restrictions:** Distance from schools, churches.

**Moratoriums:** No new licenses in certain areas.

**Waiting Lists:** Years-long waits for new licenses.

Scarcity increases value and fraud incentive.
