## What is a Parklet Permit?

During the pandemic, many cities allowed restaurants to build "Parklets"—wooden platforms in parking spots for outdoor dining. To do this, the restaurant must have an **Outdoor Dining Permit**.

This permit is a **Safety License**. It proves:
1.  **Barriers:** The parklet has heavy steel or concrete barriers to protect diners from cars.
2.  **ADA:** The platform has a ramp for wheelchairs.
3.  **Rent:** The restaurant is paying the city for the used parking space.

Illegal parklets are a major hazard. Verified permits allow neighbors and city workers to scan the card in the window and see the **verified safety scope** instantly.

## Verification Architecture

**The Temporary outdoor dining and parklet permits Fraud Problem**

Document fraud creates significant risks:

- **Fabrication:** Entirely fake documents created from scratch
- **Alteration:** Genuine documents with modified content (dates, amounts, names)
- **Impersonation:** Documents falsely claiming to be from legitimate issuers
- **Expired/Revoked Documents:** Presenting invalid documents as current
- **Permit Sharing:** Using one property's permit for work at another location
- **Scope Expansion:** Expanding permitted activities beyond authorization
- **Contractor Fraud:** Claiming permits that were never obtained

OCR-to-hash verification addresses fake and altered documents. Domain binding confirms the claimed issuer actually issued the document.

**Issuer Types**

Who issues these documents and operates verification endpoints?

**Government Entities:** Counties, cities, and special districts maintain property records.

**Title Companies:** Title insurers and escrow companies for transaction documents.

**Lending Institutions:** Banks and mortgage companies for loan documents.

**Appraisal Firms:** Licensed appraisers for property valuations.

**System Integration**

Real estate verification connects to property systems:

**Recording Systems:** County recorder systems for property document registration.

**MLS Integration:** Multiple listing services for property documentation.

**Title Plants:** Title companies maintain verification for title searches.

**E-Recording:** Electronic recording systems generate verification at recording.

## Rationale

Prevents unpermitted parklets. Domain binding verifies planning/public works. ADA compliance verification. Health permit verification. Prevents sidewalk obstruction violations.
