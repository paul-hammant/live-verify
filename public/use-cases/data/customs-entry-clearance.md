## What is a Customs Entry?

When a shipping container arrives in a country, the importer must file a **Customs Entry (CBP Form 7501 in the US)**. This is the official "Tax Return" for the shipment.

It proves:
1.  **What is inside:** (e.g., "Machinery Parts").
2.  **The Value:** "Worth $100,000."
3.  **The Duty:** "Paid $12,450 in tax."

Verification is critical for lenders who use "Imported Inventory" as collateral. A verified 7501 proves that the goods were legally imported and that the government doesn't have a "Senior Lien" for unpaid duties.

## Data Verified

Entry Number, Importer name, Broker ID, Entry Type (e.g., Consumption, Bonded, FTZ), Port of Entry, HS Code classification, merchandise value, duty amount paid, liquidation date, release status.

**Document Types:**
- **CBP Form 7501:** Entry Summary (The "Official" proof of duty payment).
- **Delivery Order:** Issued by broker to carrier once cleared.
- **Customs Release (Form 3461):** Preliminary release from the terminal.
- **Notification of Liquidation:** Final legal closing of the entry.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`cbp.gov`, `hmrc.gov.uk`) and current entry standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Released** — Goods cleared for domestic use.
- **Liquidated** — Entry finalized; no further duty changes.
- **In-Bond** — Moving under bond; duty not yet paid.
- **Seized/Hold** — Customs has frozen the shipment.

## Second-Party Use

The **Importer** or **Customs Broker** benefits from verification.

**Payment Disputes:** Proving to a customer that the $12,450 "Duty Charge" on the invoice was actually paid to the government and isn't a "Fake Fee" added by the broker.

**Audit Readiness:** During a "Focus Assessment" (audit), the importer can provide verified digital hashes of their entries to prove 100% compliance without mailing thousands of paper 7501s to the government.

## Third-Party Use

**Lenders / Factors**
**Inventory Verification:** Verifying that "Imported Inventory" in a warehouse has actually cleared customs and all duties are paid. Unpaid duties are a "Senior Lien" that takes priority over the bank's security interest.

**Domestic Buyers**
**Resale Compliance:** A buyer of high-value machinery (e.g., an MRI machine) can verify that the unit was legally imported and all duties were settled, protecting them from future seizure by the government for "Origin/Duty Fraud."

**Supply Chain Auditors**
**Sourcing Integrity:** Verifying that a supplier isn't bypassing trade sanctions or anti-dumping duties by misclassifying goods on the entry summary.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Double Invoice" Fraud Problem**

- **Duty Evasion:** Showing a "Low Value" entry summary to Customs to save money, but showing a "High Value" one to the bank to get a bigger loan.
- **HS Code Tampering:** Editing the paper 7501 to show a "Duty-Free" code while the actual government record shows a 25% tariff was paid (or bypassed).
- **Fictitious Entry:** Creating a fake 7501 to get a "Customs Refund" or "Drawback" from the government for goods that were never actually imported.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**National Customs Agencies:** (U.S. CBP, U.K. HMRC, German Zoll).
**Authorized Customs Brokers.**
**Trade Platforms:** (e.g., Flexport, Expeditors).

## Jurisdictional Witnessing

A jurisdiction may require the issuer to retain a **witnessing firm** for regulatory compliance. The witnessing firm:

- Receives all hashes from the issuer, and any subsequent changes to the payload as they happen—which may manifest as a new hash, a status change, or even a 404 (record deleted)
- Receives structured content/metadata (key identifiers and dates)
- Does **NOT** receive plaintext or sensitive personal information
- Provides an immutable, timestamped audit trail—available to the jurisdiction on demand, to document holders/third parties during disputes, or as expert witness testimony in legal proceedings

This provides:
- **Non-repudiation:** Issuer cannot deny issuing the document
- **Timestamp proof:** Document existed at a specific time
- **Regulatory audit:** Jurisdictions can inspect the witness ledger for fraud detection
- **Resilience:** Verification works even if issuer's systems go down

**Public Blockchain (Non-Party)**

Witnessing firms may periodically commit rollups to an inexpensive public blockchain, providing an ultimate immutability guarantee. The blockchain is a "non-party"—infrastructure, not a participant in the transaction. This creates multiple verification paths:

1. **Issuer domain** — Direct check against the issuer
2. **Witnessing firm** — Independent confirmation with timestamp
3. **Public blockchain** — Decentralized trust anchor via rollup inclusion


## Competition vs. ACE Portal / Single Window

| Feature | OCR-to-Hash | ACE Portal (Gov) | Scanned PDF |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Bound to the Gov. | **Database.** Direct access. | **Zero.** Easily forged. |
| **Accessibility** | **Open.** Any bank or buyer can verify. | **Restricted.** Requires Gov credentials and Vetting. | **Instant.** |
| **Speed** | **Instant.** Scan the paper. | **Slow.** Requires login and manual entry search. | **Instant.** |
| **Integrity** | **Binds Content.** Proves the *Duty Paid* matches. | **Data-Only.** | **Vulnerable.** |

**Why OCR wins here:** The "Downstream Trust" gap. Government "Single Window" portals (like ACE) are for the government and brokers. Lenders, auditors, and domestic buyers are locked out. OCR-to-hash turns the **Official Paper Filling** into a public-facing trust bridge, allowing the private sector to leverage government data without needing a government login.
