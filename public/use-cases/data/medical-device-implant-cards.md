## Data Verified

Patient name, date of birth, device serial number, UDI (Unique Device Identifier), implanting surgeon name, hospital/facility ID, date of implantation, MRI safety status (e.g., "MRI Conditional"), issuing manufacturer name.

**Document Types:**
- **Patient Implant Card:** Carried in the wallet for life.
- **Surgical Implant Log:** (Linked hash) from the hospital's EMR.
- **Device Registration Confirmation:** Proving the warranty is active.
- **Recall Notice:** (Linked hash) proving the specific serial number status.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`medtronic.com`, `bostonscientific.com`, `stryker.com`) and current device standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Verified** — Device record matches the manufacturer's secure ledger.
- **Recall Active** — **ALERT:** This specific serial number is subject to a mandatory safety recall.
- **Battery Alert** — (For active devices) End-of-service warning verified.
- **Invalid** — Serial number or patient data mismatch.

## Second-Party Use

The **Patient (Implant Recipient)** benefits from verification.

**MRI Safety:** Proving to a radiologist that their deep brain stimulator or pacemaker is "Verified MRI Conditional." Radiologists are extremely risk-averse; a verified hash from the manufacturer provides the immediate confidence needed to proceed with a life-saving scan without waiting for a manual phone call to the manufacturer's tech support.

**Emergency Care:** Proving their device details to an ER doctor in a foreign city or hospital, ensuring they don't receive treatments (like defibrillation or electrocautery) that could damage the implant.

## Third-Party Use

**Radiology Departments (MRI/CT)**
**Safety Triage:** Instantly verifying the "MRI Conditionality" of a patient's implant. OCR-to-hash connects the tech directly to the manufacturer's safety database, bypassing the "Manual Model Lookup" bottleneck.

**Airport Security (TSA)**
**Expedited Screening:** Verifying the "Implant Status" of a traveler who cannot go through a standard metal detector, reducing the friction of a manual pat-down.

**Medical Device Manufacturers**
**Post-Market Surveillance:** Ensuring 100% accurate tracking of high-risk implants throughout the patient's lifetime for recall and safety monitoring.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Serial Swap" Fraud Problem**

- **Recall Hiding:** A manufacturer or clinic attempting to hide that a specific serial number is part of a defective batch. Verification shows the "Recall Active" flag instantly.
- **Component Forgery:** Creating a fake card for a non-existent or un-vetted implant to justify a medical insurance claim.
- **Status Misrepresentation:** Editing a card to say "MRI Safe" when the device is actually "MRI Unsafe."

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**Medical Device Manufacturers:** (Medtronic, Boston Scientific, Stryker).
**Hospitals & Surgical Centers.**
**Global UDI Databases:** (e.g., GUDID - hosting the master device hashes).

**Privacy Salt:** Critical. Implant data is highly sensitive health info. The hash MUST be salted to prevent "Mass Scraping" of patient identities linked to specific expensive medical devices.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing

A jurisdiction may require the issuer to retain a **witnessing firm** for regulatory compliance. The witnessing firm:

- Receives all hashes from the issuer, and any subsequent changes to the payload as they happen—which may manifest as a new hash, a status change, or even a 404 (record deleted)
- Receives structured content/metadata (key identifiers and dates)
- Does **NOT** receive plaintext or sensitive personal information
- Provides an immutable, timestamped audit trail—available to the jurisdiction on demand, to document holders/third parties during disputes, or as expert witness testimony in legal proceedings

This provides:
- **Non-repudiation:** Issuer cannot deny issuing the document
- **Timestamp proof:** Document existed at a specific time
- **Regulatory audit:** Jurisdictions can inspect the witness ledger for fraud detection
- **Resilience:** Verification works even if issuer's systems go down

**Public Blockchain (Non-Party)**

Witnessing firms may periodically commit rollups to an inexpensive public blockchain, providing an ultimate immutability guarantee. The blockchain is a "non-party"—infrastructure, not a participant in the transaction. This creates multiple verification paths:

1. **Issuer domain** — Direct check against the issuer
2. **Witnessing firm** — Independent confirmation with timestamp
3. **Public blockchain** — Decentralized trust anchor via rollup inclusion


## Competition vs. UDI Barcodes

| Feature | OCR-to-Hash | GS1 / UDI Barcode | Physical Implant Card |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Bound to the Manufacturer. | **Self-Contained.** Trust the data *on* the sticker. | **Zero.** Easily forged. |
| **Freshness** | **Real-time.** Shows if recalled *today*. | **Static.** Only shows what was printed years ago. | **Static.** |
| **Integrity** | **Cryptographic.** Binds the *Serial #*. | **Medium.** Easy to clone a barcode. | **Vulnerable.** |
| **Hardware** | **Universal.** Any smartphone camera. | **Specialized.** Requires 2D barcode scanners. | **Visual.** |

**Why OCR wins here:** The "Wallet Reality." Patients carry a card, not a barcode scanner. While the *box* has a UDI barcode, the *patient* only has the paper card. OCR-to-hash turn that **Wallet Card** into a live safety portal, bringing "UDI-level" security to the patient's everyday life.
