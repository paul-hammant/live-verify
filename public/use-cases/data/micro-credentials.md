## What is a Micro-Credential?

Traditional credentials are coarse: degrees, certifications, licenses. **Micro-credentials** are granular—specific skills, completed modules, demonstrated competencies. They're stackable, composable, and more precise than "has a degree in X."

## Why Micro-Credentials Matter

**Precision:** "Knows Python" is vague. "Completed advanced pandas data manipulation with 92% assessment score" is specific.

**Currency:** A 2015 degree doesn't prove 2025 skills. Recent micro-credentials show current competency.

**Accessibility:** Not everyone has degrees. Micro-credentials recognize skills however acquired.

**Composability:** Stack credentials to show depth. Five related micro-credentials may be more meaningful than one broad certification.

## Data Verified

Issuing organization, holder identifier, credential name/code, level, assessment method, score/result, completion date, assessor (if applicable), expiration (if applicable).

**Document Types:**
- **Skill Module:** Specific training unit completion
- **Practical Competency:** Hands-on skill demonstration
- **Peer Attestation:** Colleagues vouching for demonstrated ability
- **Continuing Education:** Professional development credits (CME, CLE, CPE)
- **Language Proficiency:** Standardized language test scores
- **Open Badge:** Interoperable digital credentials (IMS Global standard)
- **Project Completion:** Verified contribution to specific work

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (training provider, professional body, peer network) and credential status.

**Status Indications:**
- **Valid** — Credential current and verified
- **Expired** — Validity period has passed (may still show historical competency)
- **Superseded** — Replaced by updated version (e.g., new technology version)
- **Revoked** — Credential withdrawn (fraud, misconduct, or issuer policy)

## Second-Party Use

The **Credential Holder** benefits from verification.

**Job Applications:** Prove specific skills without relying on resume claims.

**Skill Stacking:** Show progression through related credentials to demonstrate depth.

**Continuous Learning:** Verified record of ongoing professional development.

## Third-Party Use

**Employers**
**Hiring Decisions:** Verify claimed skills before interviews. Filter candidates by verified competencies.

**Professional Bodies**
**Membership Requirements:** Verify continuing education credits for license renewal.

**Educational Institutions**
**Credit Transfer:** Accept verified micro-credentials toward degree requirements.

**Clients**
**Contractor Vetting:** Verify specific skills relevant to the project.

## Verification Architecture

**Issuer Diversity**

Unlike traditional credentials (few universities, few certifying bodies), micro-credentials come from:
- Training platforms (Coursera, LinkedIn Learning, AWS)
- Professional bodies (AMA, IEEE, CFA Institute)
- Employers (internal training verified externally)
- Peer networks (colleague attestations)
- Open badge issuers (anyone following the standard)

**Assessment Rigor Spectrum**

Micro-credentials vary in rigor:
- **Completion only:** Watched the video (low signal)
- **Assessment passed:** Demonstrated knowledge (medium signal)
- **Practical demonstration:** Did the thing supervised (high signal)
- **Peer attestation:** Others vouch from experience (social signal)

Verification shows the type, letting consumers weight appropriately.

**Peer Attestation Model**

Colleagues can vouch for skills:
- Attestor's own credentials are verifiable
- Relationship context (worked together at X)
- Specificity of claim ("deployed 3 production ML models together")

The attestation is only as credible as the attestor—but that's now verifiable.

**Stacking and Pathways**

Micro-credentials can compose:
```
AWS Cloud Practitioner (foundation)
  + AWS Solutions Architect - Associate
  + AWS Lambda Deep Dive
  + AWS Security Specialty
= Demonstrated cloud architecture progression
```

Verification shows the complete stack.

## Novel Applications

**Skills-Based Hiring**
Job requirements as credential checklists. Applicants show verified credentials; system confirms match.

**Dynamic Team Assembly**
Project needs X, Y, Z skills. Query verified credential database to find qualified people.

**Credential Decay Modeling**
Some skills get stale (last Python course was 2018). Freshness weighting in verification response.

**Learning Pathway Recommendations**
Based on verified credentials held, suggest next credentials for career goals.


## Jurisdictional Witnessing

A jurisdiction may require the issuer to retain a **witnessing firm** for regulatory compliance. The witnessing firm:

- Receives all hashes from the issuer, and any subsequent changes to the payload as they happen—which may manifest as a new hash, a status change, or even a 404 (record deleted)
- Receives structured content/metadata (key identifiers and dates)
- Does **NOT** receive plaintext or sensitive personal information
- Provides an immutable, timestamped audit trail—available to the jurisdiction on demand, to document holders/third parties during disputes, or as expert witness testimony in legal proceedings

This provides:
- **Non-repudiation:** Issuer cannot deny issuing the document
- **Timestamp proof:** Document existed at a specific time
- **Regulatory audit:** Jurisdictions can inspect the witness ledger for fraud detection
- **Resilience:** Verification works even if issuer's systems go down

**Jurisdictional Requirements (Banking & Financial Services)**

Banking regulators vary widely:

**US Banks (OCC, FDIC, Federal Reserve):** Do not mandate external witnessing; verification via bank's own systems is sufficient for domestic use.

**International Banks / EU Banks (PSD2, Banking Regulation):** May require independent witness firms for cross-border transactions, especially for:
- Open Banking consent records (PSD2 compliance)
- Large cross-border transfers (suspicious activity reporting)
- Cryptocurrency/stablecoin gateway documents

**Non-Bank Financial Institutions (Credit Unions, FinTechs):** May voluntarily use witness firms to satisfy enterprise customers' audit requirements, even where not mandated by regulators.

**Public Blockchain (Non-Party)**

Witnessing firms may periodically commit rollups to an inexpensive public blockchain, providing an ultimate immutability guarantee. The blockchain is a "non-party"—infrastructure, not a participant in the transaction. This creates multiple verification paths:

1. **Issuer domain** — Direct check against the issuer
2. **Witnessing firm** — Independent confirmation with timestamp
3. **Public blockchain** — Decentralized trust anchor via rollup inclusion
