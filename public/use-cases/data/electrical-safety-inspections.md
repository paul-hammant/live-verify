## What is an Electrical System Inspection?

Fixed electrical installations (wiring, fuse boxes, panels) are a primary source of workplace fires. Under the **EAWR** (UK) and **NFPA 70E** (US), these systems must be periodically inspected by a qualified electrician to find loose connections, overloaded circuits, or degraded insulation.

**Inspection Certificates** or stickers placed on electrical panels provide the "Stamp of Safety" for the facility. "Pencil Whipping" is common here to avoid the cost of remedial wiring. Verified hashes bind the **Panel/Circuit ID, Test Result, and Electrician's License** to the contractor's or the city's domain.

## Data Verified

Panel ID, Circuit number, test date, insulation resistance (MΩ), earth loop impedance (Ω), test result (Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory), electrician name/license, next inspection date, regulation reference (e.g., BS 7671 / NFPA 70).

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (the Electrical Contractor) and the current safety standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Satisfactory** — System is safe for continued use.
- **Unsatisfactory** — **CRITICAL:** Remedial work required; fire/shock risk detected.
- **Expired** — **ALERT:** Periodic inspection is overdue.

## Second-Party Use

The **Facility Manager / Landlord** benefits from verification.
- **Insurance Compliance:** Proving to a commercial property insurer that the building's wiring is verified safe, which is often a condition of fire coverage.

## Third-Party Use

**Fire Marshals / Safety Inspectors**
- **Rapid Vetting:** Scanning stickers on panels during a fire safety audit to ensure they aren't fake or expired.

**Maintenance Engineers**
- **Safe Working:** Verifying that a specific panel was recently vetted before opening it for maintenance.


## Jurisdictional Witnessing

A jurisdiction may require the issuer to retain a **witnessing firm** for regulatory compliance. The witnessing firm:

- Receives all hashes from the issuer, and any subsequent changes to the payload as they happen—which may manifest as a new hash, a status change, or even a 404 (record deleted)
- Receives structured content/metadata (key identifiers and dates)
- Does **NOT** receive plaintext or sensitive personal information
- Provides an immutable, timestamped audit trail—available to the jurisdiction on demand, to document holders/third parties during disputes, or as expert witness testimony in legal proceedings

This provides:
- **Non-repudiation:** Issuer cannot deny issuing the document
- **Timestamp proof:** Document existed at a specific time
- **Regulatory audit:** Jurisdictions can inspect the witness ledger for fraud detection
- **Resilience:** Verification works even if issuer's systems go down

**Jurisdictional Requirements (Insurance)**

Insurance regulation is heavily fragmented:

**US Domestic Insurance:** State insurance commissioners do not mandate witness firms; companies maintain independent records via NAIC databases and state filings.

**Cross-Border Insurance / Reinsurance:** International reinsurance treaties increasingly demand independent witness firms:
- **Lloyd's of London & London Market:** Expect independent verification for catastrophe claims and high-value policies
- **EU Insurance Directive (Solvency II):** May require witness firms for cross-border policy documents
- **Bermuda (Captive Insurance):** Non-US witness firms required for policies involving US insureds to satisfy double-trigger documentation rules

**Litigation/Claims:** Once insurance moves to litigation phase, court-appointed independent witnesses become mandatory, superseding issuer verification entirely.

**Public Blockchain (Non-Party)**

Witnessing firms may periodically commit rollups to an inexpensive public blockchain, providing an ultimate immutability guarantee. The blockchain is a "non-party"—infrastructure, not a participant in the transaction. This creates multiple verification paths:

1. **Issuer domain** — Direct check against the issuer
2. **Witnessing firm** — Independent confirmation with timestamp
3. **Public blockchain** — Decentralized trust anchor via rollup inclusion
