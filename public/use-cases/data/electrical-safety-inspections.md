## What is an Electrical System Inspection?

Fixed electrical installations (wiring, fuse boxes, panels) are a primary source of workplace fires. Under the **EAWR** (UK) and **NFPA 70E** (US), these systems must be periodically inspected by a qualified electrician to find loose connections, overloaded circuits, or degraded insulation.

**Inspection Certificates** or stickers placed on electrical panels provide the "Stamp of Safety" for the facility. "Pencil Whipping" is common here to avoid the cost of remedial wiring. Verified hashes bind the **Panel/Circuit ID, Test Result, and Electrician's License** to the contractor's or the city's domain.

## Data Verified

Panel ID, Circuit number, test date, insulation resistance (MΩ), earth loop impedance (Ω), test result (Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory), electrician name/license, next inspection date, regulation reference (e.g., BS 7671 / NFPA 70).

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (the Electrical Contractor) and the current safety standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Satisfactory** — System is safe for continued use.
- **Unsatisfactory** — **CRITICAL:** Remedial work required; fire/shock risk detected.
- **Expired** — **ALERT:** Periodic inspection is overdue.

## Second-Party Use

The **Facility Manager / Landlord** benefits from verification.
- **Insurance Compliance:** Proving to a commercial property insurer that the building's wiring is verified safe, which is often a condition of fire coverage.

## Third-Party Use

**Fire Marshals / Safety Inspectors**
- **Rapid Vetting:** Scanning stickers on panels during a fire safety audit to ensure they aren't fake or expired.

**Maintenance Engineers**
- **Safe Working:** Verifying that a specific panel was recently vetted before opening it for maintenance.
