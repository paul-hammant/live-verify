## What is Ventilation Compliance?

Local Exhaust Ventilation (LEV) systems are critical for removing toxic fumes, dust, and airborne pathogens (such as COVID-19) from the workplace. Under **COSHH** (UK) and **OSHA 29 CFR 1910.94** (US), these systems must be tested and certified—typically every 14 months—to ensure they provide enough airflow to protect workers. Recent and forthcoming guidance on viral exposure also emphasizes the need for verified ventilation performance and filter schedules. "Shadow Failures" occur when a system sounds like it is working but the airflow is actually below the safety threshold. Verified hashes bind the **System ID, Measured Flow Rates, and Filter Status** to the engineering firm's domain.

## Data Verified

System ID, facility address, test date, face velocity / flow rate (m/s or fpm), filter type/status, hood number, inspector name, next test due date, regulation reference (COSHH / OSHA).

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (the Industrial Hygiene firm) and current air safety standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Certified / Safe** — System meets airflow and filtration requirements.
- **Fail / Repair Required** — **CRITICAL:** Airflow is insufficient to protect workers.
- **Expired** — **ALERT:** Mandatory 14-month test window has passed.

## Second-Party Use

The **Industrial Hygienist / Safety Manager** benefits from verification.
- **Audit Defense:** Proving to a labor union or insurance auditor that the ventilation in a hazardous zone is verified active and meeting the legal CFM (Cubic Feet per Minute) requirements.

## Third-Party Use

**Lab Staff / Factory Workers**
- **Point-of-Use Trust:** Scanning the sticker on a fume hood before starting a chemical process to ensure the air extraction is verified.

**Environmental Health Officers**
- **Incident Investigation:** Verifying the historical airflow logs after an reported exposure event to see if the system was in-spec on that date.
