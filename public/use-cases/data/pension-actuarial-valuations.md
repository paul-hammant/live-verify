## What is a Pension Actuarial Valuation?

For a defined-benefit pension plan (e.g., for teachers, police, or corporate employees), an **Actuarial Valuation** is the formal certification of the plan's health. It answers the multi-billion dollar question: "Does the plan have enough assets today to pay for all promised retirements in the future?" The result is the **Funded Status** percentage (e.g., 85%).

These documents are the "Proof of Retirement Security." Fraud is high-stakes: corrupt trustees or managers might "edit" a valuation report to turn a 60% (dangerously underfunded) plan into a 90% (healthy) plan to avoid making mandatory "Catch-up Payments" or to hide a deficit during labor negotiations. Verified hashes bind the **Total Liabilities, Net Assets, and Funded Ratio** to the actuarial firm's domain (e.g., `mercer.com` or `wtwco.com`).

## Data Verified

Plan ID number, plan name, valuation date, total accrued liability, net actuarial assets, funded status percentage, discount rate (interest rate) assumption, Enrolled Actuary ID, date of signature, signing firm name.

**Document Types:**
- **Actuarial Valuation Summary:** The primary 1-page financial summary.
- **Form 5500 Schedule SB:** The federal tax filing for pensions.
- **PBGC Premium Payment Confirmation:** Proof of federal insurance.
- **Participant Benefit Statement:** (Linked hash) for individual workers.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`mercer.com`, `milliman.com`, `wtwco.com`) and the solvency standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Verified / Funded** — The valuation matches the firm's original audit record.
- **Under-Funded Alert** — **CRITICAL:** The plan has dropped below mandatory safety levels (e.g., 80%).
- **Assumption Mismatch** — **ALERT:** The discount rate on the paper differs from the certified digital record.
- **Revoked** — **CRITICAL:** The actuary has withdrawn the valuation (e.g., due to discovered accounting errors).

## Second-Party Use

The **Plan Trustees / CFO** benefits from verification.

**Labor Negotiations:** When negotiating a new union contract, the management provides the verified hash of the pension valuation. The union can instantly see **"VERIFIED 82.5% FUNDED"** on their phone, removing the doubt that management is "Hiding a Deficit" or "Low-balling" the plan's health to avoid pay raises.

**Public Transparency:** A city government can post the verified "Pension Health Hash" on its public website. This provides citizens and bond-holders with the cryptographic proof that the city's long-term debts are accurately reported.

## Third-Party Use

**Labor Unions / Employee Groups**
**Security Audit:** A union representative scans the valuation summary posted in the breakroom. Verification ensures the version they were given is the *exact* same text the professional actuary signed, protecting the workers' future retirement.

**Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp (PBGC / Regulators)**
**Compliance Audit:** Verifying that thousands of private-sector plans are accurately reporting their liabilities. OCR-to-hash ensures that the "Paper Filings" in the PBGC office haven't been "Edited" to hide a funding gap.

**Municipal Bond Investors**
**Risk Due Diligence:** Before buying a city's bonds, an investor scans the verified pension hashes. This ensure the "Off-Balance-Sheet Liability" of the pension fund is an authentic fact, protecting the investor from a "Hidden Default."

## Verification Architecture

**The "Asset Padding" Fraud Problem**

- **Liability Shrinking:** Manually editing a "$1.2B" liability into a "$1.0B" liability on a PDF.
- **Assumption Tampering:** Changing a 7% interest-rate assumption to 9% to make the plan look artificially healthy.
- **Date Stretching:** Presenting a 2023 valuation as if it were the "Current" 2026 record.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**National Actuarial Consulting Firms.**
**State Department of Retirement Systems.**
**Independent Plan Auditors.**

**Privacy Salt:** Highly Critical. Pension plan asset details and actuarial math are sensitive financial data. The hash must be salted and access restricted to authorized plan participants and regulators.

## Rationale

Pensions are the "Lifetime Promises" of the economy. By turning technical valuations into verifiable digital bridges, we protect the retirement security of millions and ensure that "Solvency" is based on the digital truth of the math, not the creative editing of a trustee.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing

A jurisdiction may require the issuer to retain a **witnessing firm** for regulatory compliance. The witnessing firm:

- Receives all hashes from the issuer, and any subsequent changes to the payload as they happen—which may manifest as a new hash, a status change, or even a 404 (record deleted)
- Receives structured content/metadata (key identifiers and dates)
- Does **NOT** receive plaintext or sensitive personal information
- Provides an immutable, timestamped audit trail—available to the jurisdiction on demand, to document holders/third parties during disputes, or as expert witness testimony in legal proceedings

This provides:
- **Non-repudiation:** Issuer cannot deny issuing the document
- **Timestamp proof:** Document existed at a specific time
- **Regulatory audit:** Jurisdictions can inspect the witness ledger for fraud detection
- **Resilience:** Verification works even if issuer's systems go down

**Public Blockchain (Non-Party)**

Witnessing firms may periodically commit rollups to an inexpensive public blockchain, providing an ultimate immutability guarantee. The blockchain is a "non-party"—infrastructure, not a participant in the transaction. This creates multiple verification paths:

1. **Issuer domain** — Direct check against the issuer
2. **Witnessing firm** — Independent confirmation with timestamp
3. **Public blockchain** — Decentralized trust anchor via rollup inclusion
