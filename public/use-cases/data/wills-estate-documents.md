## What is a Will?

A **Last Will and Testament** is the final legal declaration of a person's wishes regarding the distribution of their property after death. It is the "Moral and Legal anchor" of an estate.

It defines:
1.  **Beneficiaries:** Who gets the money, the house, and the family heirlooms.
2.  **Guardianship:** Who will raise any surviving minor children.
3.  **The Executor:** The trusted person who will manage the "Probate" process.

**"Will Tampering"** is a common and high-stakes fraud. Because wills are often multi-page documents held together by a simple staple, criminals (or disgruntled family members) use **"Page Substitution"**—they remove a single middle page and replace it with a forged one that changes a $10,000 bequest into a $100,000 one. OCR-to-hash provides **Per-Page Verification**, binding the specific text of every page to the law firm's or the state will registry's domain.

## Data Verified

Testator name, Date of Execution, Witness names, Executor/Personal Representative name, Page Number (e.g., "Page 1 of 12"), Revision ID, Law firm/Attorney ID, Drafting date.

**Document Types:**
- **Last Will and Testament:** The primary testamentary document.
- **Codicil:** A formal amendment to an existing Will (linked hash).
- **Pour-Over Will:** Used in conjunction with a Living Trust.
- **Self-Proving Affidavit:** Notarized proof that the witnesses saw the signing.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (the Drafting Attorney or a State Will Registry) and the document standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Valid/Latest** — This is the most recent version of the Will known to the issuer.
- **Superseded** — **ALERT:** A newer Will or Codicil has been issued (linked hash).
- **Revoked** — The Testator has explicitly cancelled this Will.
- **Admitted to Probate** — Document has been verified and accepted by a court.

## Second-Party Use

The **Testator (Principal)** benefits from verification.

**Safe Keeping:** Ensuring that the version of the Will they leave in their safe deposit box is "Verified Current." If they update their Will 5 years later, the verification status of the old paper Will instantly changes to "Superseded," preventing their family from accidentally probating the wrong document.

**Estate Review:** During an annual checkup with their lawyer, scanning the hash to confirm the document in their hand matches the lawyer's "Master File."

## Third-Party Use

**Probate Attorneys**
**Integrity Checks:** Before filing a Will with the court, the lawyer scans every page. "Verified by Drafting-Firm.com" ensures that no pages were swapped or "edited" by a beneficiary during the years the Will sat in a home safe.

**Probate Court Clerks**
**Admission Speed:** Instantly verifying the authenticity of a Will submitted for probate. This reduces the need for "Witness Testimony" to prove the Will is real, potentially saving the estate thousands in legal fees.

**Executor (Banker/Accountant)**
**Due Diligence:** Confirming they are following the **Latest Verified Instructions** before they begin the high-liability work of distributing assets.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Staple and Swap" Fraud Problem**

- **Page Substitution:** Removing a page that gives a house to "Charity A" and replacing it with a fake page that gives the house to "Son B."
- **Will Suppression:** Hiding a new Will to ensure an older, more favorable Will is used. OCR-to-hash stops this by showing the old Will as "Superseded" when scanned.
- **Codicil Forgery:** Creating a fake 1-page "Amendment" that changes the Executor to a fraudster.

**Issuer Types**

**Estate Planning Attorneys:** (The primary source).
**State Will Registries:** (e.g., North Carolina or International Will Registry).
**Corporate Trust Companies.**

## Competition vs. Physical Security (Watermarks)

| Feature | OCR-to-Hash | Watermarked Paper | Online Court Docket |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Tamper Detection** | **High.** Protects the actual text. | **Low.** Only protects the paper. | **High.** |
| **Versioning** | **Real-time.** Shows "Superseded." | **Zero.** Paper doesn't change. | **Manual.** |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Bound to the Lawyer. | **Printer-Bound.** | **System-Bound.** |
| **Cost** | **Free.** (Standard web hosting). | **High.** Specialized paper/ink. | **Medium.** Access fees. |

**Why OCR wins here:** The "Privacy Gap." Most people do not want to file their Will with a public court while they are still alive. OCR-to-hash allows for **"Private Integrity"**—the Will stays in a private safe, but its cryptographic integrity is anchored to the lawyer's domain, ensuring it remains "Un-altered and Current" until the day it is needed.
