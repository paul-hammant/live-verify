## What is an Extortion Authorization?

When a company is hit by **Ransomware** (hackers locking their servers and demanding Bitcoin), the situation is chaotic. The company must decide: "Do we pay the criminals or lose our data?"

If they have Cyber Insurance, the insurer provides an **Extortion Payment Authorization**. This is the formal "OK" stating the insurer will reimburse the ransom.

Because these authorizations trigger multimillion-dollar crypto-payments, they are high-stakes. Fraud happens when rogue IT staff fabricate an authorization to trick the CFO into releasing Bitcoin to a private wallet. Verified hashes ensure the "OK" actually came from the insurer's domain.

## Data Verified

Insured name, incident ID, threat actor name (if known), ransomware strain, approved payment ceiling, authorized negotiator firm, OFAC/Sanctions clearance status, date of authorization, underwriter ID.

**Document Types:**
- **Extortion Payment Authorization:** Legal "Go-ahead" from the insurer.
- **Incident Response Summary:** Detailed timeline of the breach.
- **Bitcoin/Monero Payment Receipt:** Proving the ransom was actually paid.
- **Post-Breach Remediation Plan:** (Linked hash) for regulatory compliance.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`beazley.com`, `chubb.com`) and incident status.

**Status Indications:**
- **Authorized** — Underwriter has approved the ransom negotiation.
- **Settled** — Ransom paid; decryptors verified.
- **In-Litigation** — Claim denied (e.g., for failure to maintain security patches).
- **Compliance Hold** — Halted due to sanctions/legal conflict.

## Second-Party Use

The **Insured Company** (Victim) benefits from verification.

**Board Assurance:** Proving to the Board of Directors that the $2.5M ransom payment isn't an "Unauthorized Bribe" but is a verified, legally vetted insurance authorization. This protects the C-suite from shareholder lawsuits.

**Sanctions Defense:** Proving to Treasury/OFAC that the company performed a verified sanctions check before wiring crypto to a threat actor, avoiding multi-million dollar federal fines.

## Third-Party Use

**Federal Regulators (FBI / CISA)**
**Breach Monitoring:** Regulators can verify the "Official Data" of a breach report without seeing the victim's private emails. OCR-to-hash ensures the victim isn't under-reporting the scale of data exfiltration.

**External Audit (Big 4)**
**Financial Reporting:** Auditors verify that the multimillion-dollar "Special Expense" on the balance sheet is backed by a verified insurance claim and isn't a cover-up for internal embezzlement.

**Cyber-Forensics Firms**
**Negotiation History:** Firms like Kivu or Mandiant can verify prior authorization limits before engaging with a threat actor on behalf of a client.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Double Extortion" Fraud Problem**

- **Ghost Payments:** Rogue IT employees fabricating a "Ransomware Event" and creating fake "Insurance Authorizations" to trick the CFO into releasing Bitcoin to a private wallet.
- **Sanctions Forgery:** Editing a "Failed" sanctions check to read "Passed" to bypass bank security controls.
- **Limit Padding:** Altering a $500k authorization to read $5M to hide a massive internal theft under the cover of a cyber-incident.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**Cyber Underwriters:** (Beazley, Chubb, Munich Re).
**Incident Response Firms:** (Mandiant, CrowdStrike, Kivu).
**Gov Agencies:** (Treasury/OFAC - providing sanctions clearance hashes).

**Privacy Salt:** ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL. Ransomware events are highly confidential. The hash MUST be salted to prevent "Guessing" which companies are currently under attack.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing

A jurisdiction may require the issuer to retain a **witnessing firm** for regulatory compliance. The witnessing firm:

- Receives all hashes from the issuer, and any subsequent changes to the payload as they happen—which may manifest as a new hash, a status change, or even a 404 (record deleted)
- Receives structured content/metadata (key identifiers and dates)
- Does **NOT** receive plaintext or sensitive personal information
- Provides an immutable, timestamped audit trail—available to the jurisdiction on demand, to document holders/third parties during disputes, or as expert witness testimony in legal proceedings

This provides:
- **Non-repudiation:** Issuer cannot deny issuing the document
- **Timestamp proof:** Document existed at a specific time
- **Regulatory audit:** Jurisdictions can inspect the witness ledger for fraud detection
- **Resilience:** Verification works even if issuer's systems go down

**Public Blockchain (Non-Party)**

Witnessing firms may periodically commit rollups to an inexpensive public blockchain, providing an ultimate immutability guarantee. The blockchain is a "non-party"—infrastructure, not a participant in the transaction. This creates multiple verification paths:

1. **Issuer domain** — Direct check against the issuer
2. **Witnessing firm** — Independent confirmation with timestamp
3. **Public blockchain** — Decentralized trust anchor via rollup inclusion


## Competition vs. Secure Portals

| Feature | OCR-to-Hash | Secure Underwriter Portal | Scanned PDF Report |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Bound to the Insurer. | **System-Bound.** | **Zero.** Easily forged. |
| **Privacy** | **High.** Share only the *Authorization*. | **Low.** Portal access often reveals full policy/history. | **Medium.** |
| **Immutability** | **High.** Once hashed, the record is fixed. | **Dynamic.** System records can be edited. | **Vulnerable.** |
| **User Control** | **High.** Victim chooses when to share. | **Low.** Data controlled by the Insurer. | **High.** |

**Why OCR wins here:** The "Fog of War." During a ransomware attack, the victim's internal systems are often **down**. They are communicating via personal phones and printed papers. OCR-to-hash allows them to have **cryptographic trust** in the emergency papers they are receiving from their insurer, even when their own network is encrypted.
