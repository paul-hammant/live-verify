## What is a Stock Certificate?

Before electronic trading, ownership of a company was proven by a physical paper **Stock Certificate**.

While public stocks (like Apple) are now digital, **Private Companies** and **Small Businesses** still use paper certificates or PDF equivalents to prove who owns the business.

If you are buying a small business or investing in a private startup, you need to verify the seller actually owns the shares they are selling. Fraudsters often sell "fake shares" in companies they don't own. Verified hashes link the certificate directly to the Company Secretary or Transfer Agent's ledger, preventing duplicate sales.

Shareholder name, number of shares, share class, certificate number, company name and jurisdiction, issue date, par value (if any), transfer agent name, CUSIP/ISIN number, authorized signatures, any restrictive legends, transfer endorsements.

**Document Types:**
- **Stock Certificates:** Physical representation of share ownership
- **Share Transfer Instruments:** Stock powers, assignment forms

- **Restricted Stock Agreements:** Vesting schedules and restrictions
- **Convertible Instruments:** Convertible notes, SAFE agreements
- **Warrant Certificates:** Rights to purchase shares at fixed price
- **Option Grant Notices:** Employee stock option documentation

**The Physical Certificate Reality:** While most public company shares are held in "street name" through DTC (book-entry), private company shares, estate settlements, and historical certificates remain physical documents requiring verification.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (the company or transfer agent) and the responder text.

**Status Indications:**
- **Valid** - Certificate is current and represents active ownership
- **Cancelled** - Shares have been transferred or redeemed
- **Replaced** - Lost certificate replaced with new number
- **Restricted** - Subject to transfer restrictions or vesting
- **Converted** - Converted to different security class
- **Escrow** - Shares held in escrow

**Share Count Confirmation:** Verification may confirm shares: "Valid - 10,000 shares of Class A Common Stock."

## Verification Architecture

**The Stock Certificate Fraud Problem**

Certificate fraud enables significant theft:

- **Forged Certificates:** Entirely fake certificates with fabricated share counts
- **Altered Certificates:** Genuine certificates with modified share numbers
- **Cancelled Presented as Valid:** Cancelled certificates used fraudulently
- **Impersonation:** Certificates attributed to wrong shareholders
- **Duplicate Claims:** Same shares claimed by multiple parties
- **Restrictive Legend Removal:** Removing transfer restrictions

OCR-to-hash addresses forgery and alteration. Transfer agent records confirm current ownership status.

**Companies and Transfer Agents as Issuers**

Multiple parties may verify certificates:

**The Issuing Company:** Maintains share records, especially for private companies.

**Transfer Agents:** Computershare, Broadridge, AST for public companies.

**Company Secretary/Legal:** Private companies without transfer agents.

**Cap Table Platforms:** Carta, Shareworks, Pulley for modern private companies.

Each maintains verification endpoints for certificates in their records.

**Ornate Certificate Design**

Stock certificates have security features:

**Intricate Borders:** Decorative borders difficult to replicate.

**Watermarks:** Embedded security features in paper.

**Microprinting:** Fine print visible under magnification.

**Serial Numbers:** Unique certificate numbers.

**CUSIP Numbers:** Standardized security identifiers.

OCR must handle ornate formatting while capturing verified data elements.

**Restrictive Legends**

Common restrictions on private company shares:

**Securities Act Legends:** Unregistered securities restrictions.

**Lock-Up Provisions:** Post-IPO sale restrictions.

**Right of First Refusal:** Company/shareholder purchase rights.

**Vesting Requirements:** Time-based or performance vesting.

**Board Approval:** Transfers require board consent.

Verification should indicate restriction status: "Valid - Subject to ROFR and 1-year lock-up."

**Lost Certificate Procedures**

When certificates go missing:

**Affidavit of Loss:** Shareholder sworn statement.

**Indemnity Bond:** Insurance against claims on original.

**Replacement Issuance:** New certificate with new number.

**Original Cancellation:** Original marked cancelled if later found.

Verification must track replacement relationship: "Original Certificate #12345 replaced by #12346."

**Book-Entry vs. Physical**

The dematerialization trend:

**DTC/Cede & Co.:** Most public shares held in street name.

**Book-Entry Statements:** Confirmations without physical certificates.

**Physical Certificates:** Still common for private companies, estates.

**Uncertificated Shares:** Some jurisdictions allow shares without certificates.

OCR-to-hash applies to physical certificates; book-entry has separate verification mechanisms.

**Transfer Documentation**

Moving shares between owners:

**Stock Power:** Assignment form on certificate reverse or separate.

**Medallion Guarantee:** Signature guarantee for transfers.

**Transfer Instructions:** Direction to transfer agent.

**Corporate Resolutions:** Board approval where required.

Both the certificate and transfer documents may need verification.

**Corporate Actions**

Events affecting certificates:

**Stock Splits:** Certificate may represent different share count.

**Mergers:** Certificates exchanged for acquirer shares or cash.

**Recapitalizations:** Share class changes.

**Dividends:** Stock dividends may require new certificates.

Verification should reflect corporate action status: "Valid - Reflects 2:1 split effective [date]."

**International Considerations**

Cross-border share ownership:

**Bearer Shares:** Some jurisdictions (fewer now) allow bearer instruments.

**Nominee Arrangements:** Shares held by nominees.

**ADRs/GDRs:** Depositary receipts for foreign shares.

**Clearing Systems:** Euroclear, Clearstream for international settlement.

Verification architecture must accommodate international variations.

**Historical Certificates**

Collectible and archival value:

**Scripophily:** Collecting historical certificates.

**Predecessor Companies:** Certificates from merged/acquired companies.

**Defunct Companies:** Certificates from companies no longer operating.

**Historical Research:** Verifying provenance for collectors.

Historical certificates may verify as "Cancelled - Historical interest only."
