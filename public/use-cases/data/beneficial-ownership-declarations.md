## What is a UBO Declaration?

Criminals and sanctioned oligarchs often hide behind "Shell Companies." They might own 10 different companies that own each other, making it impossible to see who is really in control.

The **Ultimate Beneficial Owner (UBO)** Declaration is the document where a company must "unmask" its true human owners to the government (like FinCEN in the US).

Verifying these declarations ensures that a company opening a bank account isn't lying about who owns it, which is the primary way the world stops money laundering and terrorism financing.

## Data Verified

Reporting company name, Tax ID (EIN), Beneficial Owner names, ownership percentages, control relationships, identifying document numbers (redacted), date of filing.

**Document Types:**
- **BOI Report Extract:** Beneficial Ownership Information (under CTA).
- **UBO Self-Certification:** For bank onboarding.
- **Complex Ownership Diagram:** Visual chart of parent/subsidiary links.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`fincen.gov`, `registry.gov.uk`) and current filing status.

**Status Indications:**
- **Current** — Filing matches the latest registry record.
- **Outdated** — Ownership has changed; new filing required.
- **In-Dispute** — Control contest reported.
- **Flagged** — Associated with a sanctioned entity or person.

## Second-Party Use

The **Business Owner** benefits from verification.

**Bank Onboarding:** Proving to a bank during KYC (Know Your Customer) that the ownership structure they are presenting is the *exact same one* filed with the government. This prevents the "2-week delay" while the bank manually verifies ownership.

**Contract Bidding:** Proving transparency to a government contractor or a major corporation that the company isn't a front for a sanctioned individual.

## Third-Party Use

**Bank Compliance Officers (AML)**
**Instant KYC:** Verification allows the bank to instantly trust the paper/PDF "Declaration of Ownership" provided by the customer, as it links directly to the FinCEN or Companies House domain record.

**Supply Chain Auditors**
**Anti-Corruption:** Ensuring that "Tier 2" suppliers aren't secretly owned by the same executives as "Tier 1" suppliers (collusion detection).

**Investigative Journalists**
**Corruption Tracking:** Verifying the "Official" ownership claims of shell companies involved in public projects.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Shell Game" Fraud Problem**

- **Layering:** Creating 10 levels of shell companies to hide that a sanctioned oligarch actually owns the business.
- **Front-Men:** Listing a secretary or lawyer as the "Owner" on the paper declaration while the real owner remains hidden in the background.
- **Fabricated Filings:** Showing a fake "FinCEN Receipt" to a bank to hide that the company never actually filed its ownership report.

**Issuer Types**

**National Registries:** (e.g., U.K. Companies House, Singapore ACRA).
**Federal Agencies:** (e.g., U.S. FinCEN).
**Private Compliance Platforms:** (e.g., Dun & Bradstreet, Moody's).

**Privacy Salt:** Highly critical. Declarations contain sensitive PII. The hash must be salted to prevent "guessing" names of owners.

## Competition vs. Registry Portals

| Feature | OCR-to-Hash | Public Registry Portal | Private KYC Utility (Swift) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **User Privacy** | **High.** Only the specific company is verified. | **Low.** Many registries are public/searchable (privacy risk). | **Very Low.** Centralized data pool. |
| **Trust** | **Cryptographic.** Bound to the Gov domain. | **Medium.** Prone to UI spoofing/phishing. | **High.** But requires expensive membership. |
| **Immediacy** | **Instant.** Scan the document during onboarding. | **Slow.** Login, search, pay fee, download PDF. | **Fast.** But siloed. |

**Why OCR wins here:** It bridges the gap between the **Private Corporate File** and the **Public Government Record**. It allows a company to prove its status to a partner *without* the partner needing to independently navigate a foreign, complex, and potentially expensive government registry website.
