## What is a Donation Receipt?

If you donate $1,000 to a charity, you can lower your income taxes by $1,000. But the IRS won't just take your word for it; they need an **Official Receipt** from the charity.

"Donation Fraud" is a massive problem. Scammers use fake receipts from real charities (like the Red Cross) to claim thousands in illegal tax refunds.

Verified hashes allow the IRS to scan a receipt and see "VERIFIED" on the charity's own domain. This stops "Photoshopped" receipts and ensures that only legitimate donors get the tax break.

## Data Verified

Donor name, donation amount, date received, charity Tax ID (EIN), charity name, donation type (Cash/Stock/In-Kind), 501(c)(3) status statement, receipt serial number.

**Document Types:**
- **Annual Giving Statement:** Summary of all gifts for the year.
- **Single Gift Receipt:** Issued immediately after a donation.
- **In-Kind Donation Receipt:** Describing physical goods (e.g., clothes/cars).
- **Stock Transfer Confirmation:** For high-value security gifts.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`redcross.org`, `unicef.org`) and current standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Verified** — Receipt matches the charity's official financial record.
- **Refunded** — The donation was returned (e.g., due to credit card chargeback).
- **Void** — Transaction cancelled or re-issued.
- **In-Dispute** — Associated with a contested estate or gift.

## Second-Party Use

The **Donor** benefits from verification.

**Tax Audit Protection:** If the IRS audits a donor's 2025 return in 2028, the donor can provide the verified receipt hash. This proves the $1,000 deduction wasn't "Fabricated" or "Photoshopped," giving the auditor instant trust in the claim.

**Matching Gifts:** Proving to an employer (e.g., Google or Starbucks) that a personal donation was actually made and cleared, triggering the corporate matching funds without manual HR review.

## Third-Party Use

**The IRS / Tax Authorities**
**Enforcement:** During an audit, agents scan the receipt hash. "Verified by redcross.org" prevents the most common form of tax fraud: creating fake receipts from real charities to lower taxable income.

**Corporate Matching Platforms (Benevity)**
**Automation:** Platforms can use the verification hash to instantly validate employee donations, releasing millions in matching funds days faster than manual verification.

**Estate Attorneys**
**Gift Validation:** Verifying the charitable lead trusts and donations made by a deceased person during the probate process.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Tax Deduction" Fraud Problem**

- **Receipt Generators:** Using online templates to create fake receipts for real, high-profile charities like the Red Cross.
- **Amount Inflation:** Editing a $10 donation to read $1,000 on the paper receipt sent to the IRS.
- **Date Alteration:** Moving a January donation back to December to claim it on the previous year's tax return.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**National Non-Profits:** (Red Cross, United Way, St. Jude).
**Religious Organizations.**
**Donor Advised Funds (DAFs):** (Fidelity Charitable, Schwab Charitable).

## Jurisdictional Witnessing

A jurisdiction may require the issuer to retain a **witnessing firm** for regulatory compliance. The witnessing firm:

- Receives all hashes from the issuer, and any subsequent changes to the payload as they happen—which may manifest as a new hash, a status change, or even a 404 (record deleted)
- Receives structured content/metadata (key identifiers and dates)
- Does **NOT** receive plaintext or sensitive personal information
- Provides an immutable, timestamped audit trail—available to the jurisdiction on demand, to document holders/third parties during disputes, or as expert witness testimony in legal proceedings

This provides:
- **Non-repudiation:** Issuer cannot deny issuing the document
- **Timestamp proof:** Document existed at a specific time
- **Regulatory audit:** Jurisdictions can inspect the witness ledger for fraud detection
- **Resilience:** Verification works even if issuer's systems go down

**Public Blockchain (Non-Party)**

Witnessing firms may periodically commit rollups to an inexpensive public blockchain, providing an ultimate immutability guarantee. The blockchain is a "non-party"—infrastructure, not a participant in the transaction. This creates multiple verification paths:

1. **Issuer domain** — Direct check against the issuer
2. **Witnessing firm** — Independent confirmation with timestamp
3. **Public blockchain** — Decentralized trust anchor via rollup inclusion


## Competition vs. IRS Public Search (TEOS)

| Feature | OCR-to-Hash | IRS TEOS Search | Paper Receipt |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Integrity** | **Binds Amount.** Protects the $ value. | **Zero.** Only verifies the *Charity*, not the *Gift*. | **Zero.** Easily forged. |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Bound to the Charity. | **Gov-Bound.** | **Visual.** |
| **User Experience** | **Instant.** Scan the paper. | **Slow.** Requires typing EIN and finding the record. | **N/A.** |
| **Audit-ability** | **High.** Creates a digital audit trail. | **None.** For individual receipts. | **Low.** |

**Why OCR wins here:** The "Gift Specificity." The IRS TEOS database can tell you if the Red Cross is a real charity. It **cannot** tell you if John Doe actually gave them $1,000 on Tuesday. OCR-to-hash turns the **Static Receipt** into a live, verifiable financial link that bridges the gap between the donor's claim and the charity's ledger.
