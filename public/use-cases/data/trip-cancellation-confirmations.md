## What is a Trip Cancellation Confirmation?

In the travel industry, a **Trip Cancellation Confirmation** is the formal proof that a booking was voided. It is the "Death Certificate" for a trip. It lists which parts of the trip were refunded to the original payment method and which parts were issued as "Future Travel Credits."

These documents are the primary evidence used for **Travel Insurance Claims**. A traveler claiming $5,000 for a missed vacation must prove the trip was actually cancelled and show exactly how much the airline *didn't* refund. Fraud is rampant: people "Photoshop" a standard cancellation email to hide a partial refund they already received, or they create fake "Cancellation Notices" for trips they never booked to scam their insurer. Verified hashes bind the **Refund Amounts, Cancellation Reason, and Booking Reference** to the provider's domain (e.g., `britishairways.com` or `booking.com`).

## Data Verified

Booking reference (PNR), passenger name, flight/itinerary details, cancellation timestamp, reason for cancellation (e.g., Illness, Weather), itemized refund amounts (taxes vs. fare), future travel credit value, airline ID.

**Document Types:**
- **Cancellation Confirmation Email:** The primary digital record.
- **Refund Voucher:** Proving the cash return to the credit card.
- **No-Show Certificate:** Proving the passenger didn't board (required for some claims).
- **Insurance Claim Form Supplement:** (Linked hash) provided by the airline.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`ba.com`, `expedia.com`, `marriott.com`) and the booking standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Cancelled / Refunded** — Booking is void; funds returned as stated.
- **Cancelled / Credit Issued** — Booking void; funds held as Future Travel Credit.
- **Active / Boarded** — **ALERT:** The trip was NOT cancelled (indicates insurance fraud).
- **Modification Pending** — A change request is active but not finalized.

## Second-Party Use

The **Traveler** (second party) receives the cancellation confirmation from the airline or travel provider (first party), **keeps it**, and may later hand it to third parties for various reasons, or never do so.

**Personal Record:** The traveler has their own verified copy of the cancellation details and refund breakdown. Most of the time, the document sits in their email or travel folder—the verification value is latent, there *if needed*.

**Peace of Mind:** The traveler can confirm at any time that the confirmation matches what the airline's system recorded and hasn't been altered, ensuring they have accurate records of non-refundable losses.

**Future Optionality:** If a dispute arises—whether about insurance claims, employer reimbursements, or tax deductions—the traveler has cryptographic proof ready without needing to contact the airline.

## Third-Party Use

The traveler (second party) may hand the verified document to various third parties:

**Travel Insurance Underwriters (Claims Processing)**
When filing a $1,200 "Trip Interruption" claim, the traveler provides the verified hash of their BA cancellation notice. The insurer can instantly see **"VERIFIED LOSS - $1,200"** directly from the airline domain, bypassing the 3-week "Manual Verification" wait and getting the traveler paid in days.

**Travel Insurance Fraud Detection**
Insurers cross-reference "Loss Claims" with verified airline hashes. If a claimant submits a PDF showing a "$2,000 Non-Refundable Loss," but the verified hash returns **"FULLY REFUNDED TO VISA,"** the insurer can deny the claim and flag the user for fraud.

**Employers (Business Travel Reconciliation)**
An employee provides verified cancellation confirmations to prove that a cancelled business trip resulted in a "Future Travel Credit" (which belongs to the company) and not a "Cash Refund" (which the employee might try to pocket).

**Corporate Travel Management (Credit Recovery)**
TMCs automatically track all verified "Future Travel Credits" across an entire workforce to ensure that $100,000+ in corporate travel value isn't lost when credits expire.

**Tax Authorities (Business Loss Audit)**
Auditors verify that "Cancelled Travel" deductions on a corporate tax return are backed by legitimate, verified non-refundable losses.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Phantom Refund" Fraud Problem**

- **Loss Inflation:** Editing a "Partial Refund" notice to look like a "Total Loss" to get a higher insurance payout.
- **Ghost Cancellations:** Creating fake cancellation emails for a flight that the passenger actually flew on.
- **Date Tampering:** Changing the cancellation date to fall within the "Insurance Coverage Window."

**Issuer Types (First Party)**

- Airlines
- Hotels & OTAs
- Rail Operators

**Privacy Salt:** Required. Passenger names and booking codes are private. While each cancellation contains unique combinations of booking references (PNRs), passenger names, cancellation timestamps, and specific refund amounts that provide significant entropy, the sensitivity of travel patterns—and the risk that competitors could use enumeration for "cancellation mining" to track operational disruptions (e.g., how many people cancelled during a BA strike)—means salt is essential. Salt protects both passenger privacy and carrier competitive intelligence.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing

A jurisdiction may require travel providers to retain a **witnessing firm** for regulatory compliance. The witnessing firm:

- Receives all hashes from the travel provider, and any subsequent changes to the cancellation as they happen—which may manifest as a new hash, a status change (modification pending), or even a 404 (record deleted)
- Receives structured content/metadata (booking references, cancellation dates, refund amounts, credit values)
- Does **NOT** receive plaintext (passenger names, payment card details, itinerary details)
- Provides an immutable, timestamped audit trail—available to the jurisdiction on demand, to travelers/third parties during disputes, or as expert witness testimony in legal proceedings

This provides:
- **Non-repudiation:** Travel provider cannot deny issuing the cancellation or alter refund amounts
- **Timestamp proof:** Cancellation existed at a specific time (critical for insurance claim windows)
- **Regulatory audit:** Consumer protection agencies can inspect the witness ledger for refund compliance
- **Resilience:** Verification works even if travel provider's systems go down or the provider ceases operations

**Public Blockchain (Non-Party)**

Witnessing firms may periodically commit rollups to an inexpensive public blockchain, providing an ultimate immutability guarantee. The blockchain is a "non-party"—infrastructure, not a participant in the transaction. This creates multiple verification paths:

1. **Travel provider domain** — Direct check against the issuer
2. **Witnessing firm** — Independent confirmation with timestamp
3. **Public blockchain** — Decentralized trust anchor via rollup inclusion

## Rationale

Trip cancellations are the "Friction Point" of travel. By turning cancellation notices into verifiable digital bridges, we protect the insurance pool from fraud and ensure that travelers are reimbursed quickly for legitimate losses.
