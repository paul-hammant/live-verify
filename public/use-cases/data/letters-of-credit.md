## Data Verified

L/C Number, Issuing Bank name, Beneficiary name, Applicant name, Currency and exact amount (numerical/text), Expiry date, Port of Loading/Discharge, Goods description (digest), UCP version (e.g., UCP 600), date of issuance.

**Document Types:**
- **Irrevocable Letter of Credit:** The primary bank guarantee.
- **L/C Amendment:** (Linked hash) documenting changes to the credit.
- **Standby Letter of Credit (SBLC):** Used as a backup payment source.
- **Advice of Credit:** From the advising bank to the seller.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (the Issuing Bank) and current credit status.

**Status Indications:**
- **Valid/Available** — Credit is active and open for negotiation.
- **Amended** — **ALERT:** Terms have changed; view Amendment #2.
- **Drawn** — Funds have already been paid against this credit.
- **Expired** — The credit has passed its valid window.
- **Cancelled** — Retracted by mutual agreement.

## Second-Party Use

The **Beneficiary (Exporter)** benefits from verification.

**Shipping Confidence:** Before manufacturing $1.2M in custom lenses, the Swiss exporter scans the L/C hash. "Verified by HSBC" ensure the buyer hasn't "Edited" the PDF to change the payment terms from "At Sight" to "Net 90 Days" or reduced the dollar amount.

**Supply Chain Finance:** Proving the verified L/C to a local bank to get a "Pre-Export Loan" to buy raw materials. Banks only lend against L/Cs they can cryptographically trust.

## Third-Party Use

**Advising / Confirming Banks**
**Risk Transfer:** A confirming bank in Switzerland can verify the L/C against HSBC's domain before adding their own guarantee. This stops "Ghost L/Cs" from non-existent or insolvent banks.

**Logistics Carriers (Steamship Lines)**
**Title Vetting:** Verifying that the B/L they are issuing matches the verified "Goods Description" in the L/C, reducing the risk of being sued for "Misdescription."

**Customs Authorities**
**Valuation Vetting:** Verifying the actual transaction value of high-tax goods by checking the verified L/C hash.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Phantom Credit" Fraud Problem**

- **Fabricated L/Cs:** Using a template to create a fake L/C from a real bank (e.g., HSBC) to trick a supplier into shipping goods without payment.
- **Term Tampering:** Editing the "Required Documents" list to remove the need for a 3rd party inspection certificate, allowing the buyer to ship junk.
- **Amount Inflation:** Changing $100,000 to $1,000,000 to use the L/C as collateral for a fraudulent loan.

**Issuer Types**

**Global Trade Banks:** (HSBC, Citi, BNP Paribas, Standard Chartered).
**Central Banks:** (In countries with high exchange controls).
**Trade Platforms:** (e.g., Contour, Marco Polo - hosting the hashes).

## Competition vs. SWIFT (Electronic)

| Feature | OCR-to-Hash | SWIFT MT700 (Electronic) | Scanned PDF L/C |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Bound to the Bank. | **Network-Bound.** Trust the SWIFT keys. | **Zero.** Easily forged. |
| **Accessibility** | **Universal.** Any local agent/broker can verify. | **Restricted.** Only banks have SWIFT terminals. | **Universal.** |
| **Integrity** | **Binds Content.** Protects the text. | **Data-Only.** No "Human" document link. | **Vulnerable.** |
| **Interoperability** | **High.** Works across non-SWIFT fintechs. | **Limited.** Only for legacy banks. | **Universal.** |

**Why OCR wins here:** The "Non-Bank" reality. Trade finance involves non-banks (freight forwarders, insurance agents, small suppliers) who **do not have SWIFT access**. They are forced to trust a piece of paper or a PDF. OCR-to-hash turns that **Human-Readable PDF** into a cryptographically trusted artifact that anyone can verify without a $50,000/year SWIFT terminal.
