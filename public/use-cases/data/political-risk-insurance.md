## What is Political Risk Insurance (PRI)?

In international finance, **Political Risk Insurance (PRI)** is the "Shield of Sovereignty." It protects investors and lenders from losses caused by government actions—such as **Expropriation** (seizing an asset), **Currency Inconvertibility** (blocking funds from leaving the country), or **Political Violence** (war or civil unrest). These policies are mandatory for multi-billion dollar infrastructure projects in developing nations.

These documents are the "Proof of Protection." Fraud is high-stakes: a developer might create a fake "Zurich" or "Chubb" policy to trick a bank into releasing a $100M loan for a power plant. Similarly, a government might demand to see "Verified Coverage" before granting a land lease. Verified hashes bind the **Host Country, Coverage Limits, and Exclusion Clauses** to the specialist insurer's domain (e.g., `zurich.com` or `chubb.com`).

## Data Verified

Policy number, insurer name, insured entity name, host country, project name/ID, total limit of liability, sub-limits per risk type (Expropriation, PV, etc.), policy term, premium payment status, primary exclusion codes, governing law.

**Document Types:**
- **Policy Schedule:** The summary of coverage.
- **Evidence of PRI:** Provided to lenders and government partners.
- **Sovereign Guarantee Supplement:** (Linked hash) provided by the host nation.
- **Claims Settlement Letter:** Proof of payout for past political losses.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`zurich.com`, `miga.org`, `opic.gov`) and the policy standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Active / Premium Paid** — Policy is current and the project is protected.
- **Lapsed** — **ALERT:** Premium payment is overdue; coverage is suspended.
- **Claims Active** — **ALERT:** A loss event has been reported for this project.
- **Revoked** — **CRITICAL:** Policy cancelled (e.g., due to discovery of insured's illegal acts).

## Second-Party Use

The **Investor / Developer** benefits from verification.

**Debt Financing:** Before a bank releases a $50M construction draw, they scan the developer's verified PRI hash. "Verified by Zurich" ensures the bank that the "Expropriation" risk is fully mitigated, allowing the loan to move forward in high-risk jurisdictions.

**Government Negotiations:** When negotiating a "Concession Agreement" with a host country, the developer shows the verified hash. This proves to the government that the project is backed by high-tier international capital, increasing the developer's bargaining power.

## Third-Party Use

**Project Finance Banks (Lenders)**
**Risk Management:** Automatically monitoring the PRI status of a global project portfolio. If a policy hash returns **"LAPSED,"** the bank's system can instantly trigger a "Technical Default" and freeze project accounts until coverage is restored.

**Multilateral Agencies (e.g., World Bank / MIGA)**
**Compliance Audit:** Verifying that sub-contracted projects are maintaining the mandatory PRI coverage required by international development treaties.

**Sovereign Wealth Funds**
**Due Diligence:** Verifying the "Insurability" of a target infrastructure asset before making a multi-billion dollar equity investment.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Ghost Policy" Fraud Problem**

- **Limit Inflation:** Editing a $10M policy to read $100M to bypass a lender's "Minimum Coverage" requirement.
- **Exclusion Removal:** Deleting a "War Exclusion" line from a PDF before showing it to a lender in a conflict zone.
- **Phantom Carrier:** Creating fake credentials for a non-existent "Offshore Insurer" to steal project premiums.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**Global Commercial Insurers.**
**Export Credit Agencies (ECAs).**
**Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA).**

**Privacy Salt:** Highly Critical. Infrastructure project details and insurance limits are national security and high-value business secrets. The hash must be salted and access restricted to authorized financial institutions.

## Rationale

PRI is the "Safety Net of Global Development." By turning specialty policies into verifiable digital bridges, we protect the capital flowing into the world's most critical infrastructure projects from the risk of sovereign deception.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing

A jurisdiction may require the issuer to retain a **witnessing firm** for regulatory compliance. The witnessing firm:

- Receives all hashes from the issuer, and any subsequent changes to the payload as they happen—which may manifest as a new hash, a status change, or even a 404 (record deleted)
- Receives structured content/metadata (key identifiers and dates)
- Does **NOT** receive plaintext or sensitive personal information
- Provides an immutable, timestamped audit trail—available to the jurisdiction on demand, to document holders/third parties during disputes, or as expert witness testimony in legal proceedings

This provides:
- **Non-repudiation:** Issuer cannot deny issuing the document
- **Timestamp proof:** Document existed at a specific time
- **Regulatory audit:** Jurisdictions can inspect the witness ledger for fraud detection
- **Resilience:** Verification works even if issuer's systems go down

**Public Blockchain (Non-Party)**

Witnessing firms may periodically commit rollups to an inexpensive public blockchain, providing an ultimate immutability guarantee. The blockchain is a "non-party"—infrastructure, not a participant in the transaction. This creates multiple verification paths:

1. **Issuer domain** — Direct check against the issuer
2. **Witnessing firm** — Independent confirmation with timestamp
3. **Public blockchain** — Decentralized trust anchor via rollup inclusion
