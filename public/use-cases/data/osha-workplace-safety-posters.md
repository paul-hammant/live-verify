## What is an OSHA Safety Poster?

By federal law, every workplace in America must display the **OSHA Job Safety and Health** poster. It tells workers they have the right to a safe workplace and the right to report dangers without being fired.

These posters are "Mandatory Workplace Postings." If a manager "hides" the poster or puts up a fake version with the wrong phone numbers, they are violating federal law.

Verified hashes allow any worker to scan the poster and see the **un-altered federal safety rights** on the `osha.gov` domain, ensuring they have the verified information they need to protect their lives on the job.

**Privacy Salt:** Sensitive personal information requires random salt in verification lines to prevent hash enumeration.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain and the responder text (e.g., "Valid ID" or "Denied").

**Status Indications:**
- **Valid** - Document verified and current
- **Expired** - Document has reached expiration
- **Revoked** - Document has been revoked or cancelled
- **Superseded** - A newer version exists

The verification response may include additional context such as issue date, expiration date, or document serial numbers.

## Second-Party Use

The document holder (subject/recipient) benefits from verification.

**Medical Records:** Verify health documents for personal medical records.

**Provider Presentation:** Share verified results with other healthcare providers.

**Insurance Claims:** Support health insurance claims with verified documentation.

**Compliance Requirements:** Meet employer or school health documentation requirements.

**Legal Matters:** Provide verified health records for disability, litigation, or family matters.

## Third-Party Use

**Regulators and Oversight Bodies**

Regulatory compliance and oversight:

**Systematic Hash Receipt:** Receive hashes in bulk for regulatory oversight.

**Audit Verification:** Verify documents during routine or targeted audits.

**Compliance Monitoring:** Monitor issuer compliance with documentation requirements.

**Investigation Support:** Verify documents during fraud or compliance investigations.

**Consumer Protection:** Verify consumer-facing documents for protection enforcement.

**Employers**

Hiring and compliance verification:

**Pre-Employment Screening:** Verify credentials during hiring process.

**I-9 Compliance:** Verify work authorization and identity documents.

**Credential Verification:** Confirm professional licenses and certifications.

**Health Requirements:** Verify health-related documentation for workplace safety.

**Background Checks:** Integrate verification into background check processes.

**Insurance Companies**

Underwriting and claims processing:

**Policy Underwriting:** Verify supporting documents during policy issuance.

**Claims Verification:** Validate documentation during claims processing.

**Risk Assessment:** Confirm permits, licenses, and certifications for risk evaluation.

**Fraud Detection:** Identify fraudulent documentation in claims or applications.

**Coverage Disputes:** Reference verified documents in coverage determination.

**Healthcare Providers**

Medical care and coordination:

**Medical History:** Verify patient-provided medical records and test results.

**Treatment Planning:** Confirm diagnostic results for treatment decisions.

**Specialist Referrals:** Validate records when coordinating care.

**Insurance Authorization:** Verify coverage and authorization documents.

**Compliance Requirements:** Confirm vaccination and health screening records.

## Verification Architecture

**The OSHA workplace safety posters (Job Safety and Health) Fraud Problem**

Document fraud creates significant risks:

- **Fabrication:** Entirely fake documents created from scratch
- **Alteration:** Genuine documents with modified content (dates, amounts, names)
- **Impersonation:** Documents falsely claiming to be from legitimate issuers
- **Expired/Revoked Documents:** Presenting invalid documents as current

OCR-to-hash verification addresses fake and altered documents. Domain binding confirms the claimed issuer actually issued the document.

**Issuer Types**

Who issues these documents and operates verification endpoints?

**Hospitals and Health Systems:** Major healthcare providers and hospital networks.

**Clinical Laboratories:** Reference labs and hospital-based laboratories.

**Medical Clinics:** Physician practices and specialty clinics.

**Public Health Departments:** Government health agencies for certifications.

**System Integration**

Healthcare verification connects to clinical systems:

**EHR Systems:** Electronic health record systems generate verification hashes.

**Lab Information Systems:** Laboratory systems create verification for results.

**Health Information Exchanges:** Regional HIEs facilitate verification.

**FHIR Standards:** HL7 FHIR could incorporate verification endpoints.

**Privacy Considerations**

Sensitive personal information requires special handling:

**Privacy Salt:** Random salt added to verification lines prevents hash enumeration attacks.

**Minimum Disclosure:** Verification response reveals only necessary information.

**Access Controls:** Verification endpoints implement appropriate access restrictions.

**Audit Logging:** Verification attempts logged for security and compliance.

## Rationale

Prevents fake OSHA posters. Domain binding verifies DOL/OSHA (dol.gov). Federal posting requirement (all employers). OSHA inspection verification. Employee rights notification. $15,625 penalty per violation for missing/fake poster.
