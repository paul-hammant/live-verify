    "dataVisibleAfterVerification": "Shows the issuer domain and the responder text (e.g., \"Valid ID\" or \"Denied\").",
    "rationale": "Woman alone at home verifies tradesperson credentials before letting them in. Domain binding verifies government trade licensing authority (e.g., competent-person-schemes.gov.uk) or established marketplace (checkatrade.com, trustmark.org.uk). Critical dual purpose: (1) Safety - prevents unlicensed/fake tradesperson fraud targeting vulnerable people at home. (2) Accountability/tax compliance - creates paper trail for insurance claims, warranty documentation, and discourages cash-in-hand tax evasion (tradesperson knows visit is documented). Protects homeowners and promotes legitimate trade practices."
