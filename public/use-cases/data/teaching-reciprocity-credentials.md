## What are Teaching Reciprocity Credentials?

In the education sector, a **Teaching License** is state-specific. However, under **Interstate Compacts** (like NASDTEC), a teacher licensed in New York can often "Reciprocate" their license to work in California. This requires a **Letter of Good Standing** or a **Reciprocity Certificate** from the original state.

These documents are the "Keys to the Classroom." Fraud is high-stakes: individuals whose licenses were revoked for misconduct in one state often create fake "Clean" letters to find work in a different state. Verified hashes bind the **License Number, Endorsements (e.g., Special Ed), and Disciplinary Status** to the state's Department of Education domain (e.g., `nysed.gov` or `ctc.ca.gov`).

## Data Verified

Teacher name, primary state of licensure, license ID number, license type (e.g., Professional/Initial), expiration date, certified subject endorsements, disciplinary status (Clear/Flagged), background check timestamp, interstate compact eligibility code.

**Document Types:**
- **Reciprocity Certificate:** Proving status to a second state.
- **Letter of Good Standing:** For out-of-state hiring.
- **Teaching License:** The primary state-issued card.
- **Praxis Score Report:** (Linked hash) proving exam passage.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`nysed.gov`, `isbe.net`, `fldoe.org`) and the professional standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Active / Clear** — Teacher is in good standing; no disciplinary actions on file.
- **Flagged** — **ALERT:** A potential disciplinary or background issue is recorded.
- **Revoked** — **CRITICAL:** Teaching authority has been terminated in the primary state.
- **Expired** — Mandatory professional development hours not met; license inactive.

## Second-Party Use

The **Teacher / Educator** benefits from verification.

**Interstate Relocation:** A teacher moving from NY to Florida can provide the verified hash of their "NY Good Standing" letter to the Florida DOE. The Florida board can instantly see **"VERIFIED CLEAR - NYSED"** on their phone, allowing them to issue a Florida license in days instead of months.

**Substitute Hiring:** Proving to multiple school districts that their background check is verified and current, allowing them to work across district lines without re-submitting paper files to every district HR office.

## Third-Party Use

**School District HR Managers**
**Hiring Integrity:** Thousands of resumes are received for every opening. OCR-to-hash allows the HR manager to instantly filter for only verified, state-licensed candidates, protecting the school from the liability of hiring an un-certified teacher.

**National Clearinghouses (NASDTEC)**
**Disciplinary Tracking:** When a teacher is flagged for misconduct, the state updates the hash status. Every other state where that teacher applied can instantly see the **"FLAGGED"** status, stopping "State-Hopping" by bad actors.

**Parents / PTA**
**Safety Verification:** In some jurisdictions, parents can verify that their child's teacher is an authorized, background-checked professional.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Clean-Hopping" Fraud Problem**

- **Status Masking:** Editing a "Revoked" NY license into a "Clean" one to get hired in a rural district in a different state.
- **Endorsement Padding:** Adding a "Special Ed" endorsement to a standard license to qualify for a higher-paying role.
- **Background Forgery:** Creating a fake "FBI Clearance" letter to bypass child safety vetting.

**Issuer Types**

**State Departments of Education.**
**National Evaluation Series (Praxis/ETS).**
**Teacher Licensing Compacts.**

**Privacy Salt:** Critical. Teacher PII and disciplinary data are sensitive. The hash must be salted to prevent "Mass Roster Scraping" of the nation's educators.

## Rationale

Teaching is a "Trust-Based Profession." By turning licenses into verifiable digital bridges, we ensure that classroom authority is backed by cryptographic proof, protecting students and rewarding the vast majority of educators who maintain clean professional records.
