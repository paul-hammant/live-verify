## Data Verified

Manufacturer legal name, facility location, Notified Body ID (e.g., 0086), Certificate number, Device classification (I, IIa, IIb, III), specific model numbers, ISO standards met, issue date, expiration date, regulatory pathway (MDR/IVDR).

**Document Types:**
- **CE Certificate of Conformity:** Mandatory for the European market.
- **FDA 510(k) Clearance Letter:** For U.S. market entry.
- **ISO 13485 QMS Certificate:** Proving the factory meets quality laws.
- **Biocompatibility Test Report:** (Linked hash) proving the material is safe.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`bsigroup.com`, `tuvsud.com`, `fda.gov`) and current certification status.

**Status Indications:**
- **Certified/Valid** — Device meets all regulatory safety standards.
- **Recalled** — **ALERT:** Safety defect found; product must be removed from use.
- **Suspended** — Certificate paused (e.g., due to audit failure).
- **Withdrawn** — Permanently revoked due to severe non-compliance (The "MedPro" pattern).

## Second-Party Use

The **Medical Device Manufacturer** benefits from verification.

**Global Sales:** Proving to a hospital procurement team in Singapore or Dubai that their "EU CE Mark" isn't a fake document. A verified hash from BSI or TUV allows the manufacturer to bypass months of manual "Consular Legalization" of their certificates.

**Distributor Vetting:** Proving to an international distributor that the product has verified FDA clearance, allowing them to legally import and stock the device.

## Third-Party Use

**Hospital Procurement (Supply Chain)**
**Patient Safety:** Before allowing a new heart valve or surgical suture into the operating room, the hospital registrar scans the hash. "Verified by BSI" ensures the vendor isn't using a "MedPro-style" fake certificate to sell un-tested, dangerous medical gear.

**Customs / Port Authorities**
**Enforcement:** Border agents can scan the hash on the shipping crate. Verification ensure the devices aren't "Regulatory-Grade" fakes from an un-vetted factory.

**Insurance Carriers (Medical Malpractice)**
**Risk Rating:** Verifying that a hospital only uses verified, non-recalled medical devices, reducing the risk of surgical failure claims.

## Verification Architecture

**The "MedPro" Fraud Problem**

- **Fabricated Certificates:** Shady testing firms selling fake CE certificates to manufacturers of cheap masks and surgical tools (The MedPro/Intertek Scandal).
- **Scope Misrepresentation:** Taking a certificate for "Bandages" and editing the PDF to read "Surgical Implants" to charge a 100x price premium.
- **Recall Hiding:** Continuing to sell a device after the Notified Body has "Withdrawn" the certificate due to safety failures.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**Notified Bodies (EU):** (BSI, TUV, SGS, Dekra).
**Regulatory Agencies:** (FDA, EMA, MHRA).
**Accredited Testing Labs:** (ISO 17025 labs).

## Jurisdictional Witnessing

A jurisdiction may require the issuer to retain a **witnessing firm** for regulatory compliance. The witnessing firm:

- Receives all hashes from the issuer, and any subsequent changes to the payload as they happen—which may manifest as a new hash, a status change, or even a 404 (record deleted)
- Receives structured content/metadata (key identifiers and dates)
- Does **NOT** receive plaintext or sensitive personal information
- Provides an immutable, timestamped audit trail—available to the jurisdiction on demand, to document holders/third parties during disputes, or as expert witness testimony in legal proceedings

This provides:
- **Non-repudiation:** Issuer cannot deny issuing the document
- **Timestamp proof:** Document existed at a specific time
- **Regulatory audit:** Jurisdictions can inspect the witness ledger for fraud detection
- **Resilience:** Verification works even if issuer's systems go down

**Public Blockchain (Non-Party)**

Witnessing firms may periodically commit rollups to an inexpensive public blockchain, providing an ultimate immutability guarantee. The blockchain is a "non-party"—infrastructure, not a participant in the transaction. This creates multiple verification paths:

1. **Issuer domain** — Direct check against the issuer
2. **Witnessing firm** — Independent confirmation with timestamp
3. **Public blockchain** — Decentralized trust anchor via rollup inclusion


## Competition vs. EUDAMED / FDA Databases

| Feature | OCR-to-Hash | EUDAMED / FDA Database | Scanned PDF |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Bound to the Notified Body. | **Gov-Bound.** | **Zero.** Easily forged. |
| **Speed** | **Instant.** 5-second scan at procurement. | **Slow.** Requires searching by school name and state. | **Instant.** |
| **Integrity** | **Binds Models.** Protects the specific part #s. | **Data-Only.** Doesn't protect the paper. | **Vulnerable.** |
| **Immediacy** | **Real-time.** Shows "RECALLED" status in red. | **Laggy.** Database updates can take days. | **Hidden.** |

**Why OCR wins here:** The "Point of Care" reality. Doctors and hospital clerks work with paper and PDF boxes. They don't have the time to navigate complex federal government databases for every shipment. OCR-to-hash turns the **Static Certificate** into a live "Safety Beacon," ensuring that "Medical Integrity" is verified at the moment of highest risk.
