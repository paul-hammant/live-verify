## What is an Easement?

An **Easement** is a legal right to use someone else's land for a specific purpose. The most common type is a **Utility Easement**, where the city or a power company has the right to run pipes or wires through your backyard.

This "Right" is permanent and stays with the land, even if the house is sold.

Fraud happens when sellers "Hide" easements from buyers by deleting pages from legal documents. A verified easement grant ensures the buyer knows exactly where they are **not** allowed to build a pool or a fence, preventing multimillion-dollar trespassing lawsuits.

## Data Verified

Grantor name, Grantee name, legal property description (Lot/Block/Plat), easement purpose (Utility, Ingress/Egress, Conservation), width/dimensions, date of grant, Liber/Page/Document reference number, Notary identification.

**Document Types:**
- **Grant of Easement:** The primary transfer of rights.
- **Easement Appurtenant:** Linked to the land itself (survives sale).
- **Easement in Gross:** Linked to a specific person/entity (e.g., utility).
- **Termination of Easement:** Proving the right has been legally extinguished.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`marincounty.gov`, `pge.com`) and current recording status.

**Status Indications:**
- **Recorded** — Document is officially filed and legally binding.
- **Active** — Easement is currently in force.
- **Terminated** — Easement has been legally removed from the title.
- **Under Review** — Document submitted but final indexing pending.

## Second-Party Use

The **Property Owner** benefits from verification.

**Clear Title:** When selling a home, the owner can provide a verified hash of all active easements to the buyer. This prevents "Title Surprises" where a buyer's lawyer discovers an undisclosed utility line 3 days before closing.

**Fence/Construction Planning:** Proving the *exact width* of a 10-foot easement to a contractor to ensure a new fence or pool doesn't encroach on a utility company's verified legal rights.

## Third-Party Use

**Utility Companies (PG&E / Comcast)**
**Right-of-Entry:** When a crew needs to dig in a private backyard, they can show the homeowner the verified easement hash on their work order. "Verified by Marin County" prevents homeowners from calling the police for trespassing.

**Title Insurance Companies**
**Risk Underwriting:** Title officers verify that the easement they found in the historical records matches the "Final Signed Document" hash, ensuring no pages were swapped or terms edited in the archive.

**Civil Engineers / Surveyors**
**Boundary Integrity:** Instantly verifying the legal descriptions used to set stakes in the ground during a new development.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Hidden Encumbrance" Fraud Problem**

- **Scope Alteration:** Editing a "10-foot Utility Easement" to read "5-foot" to make a lot look more buildable to a buyer.
- **Easement Deletion:** Removing the page showing an "Ingress/Egress" easement for a neighboring property, which effectively "lands-locks" the neighbor.
- **Fake Signatures:** Forging a neighbor's signature on an easement grant to get a driveway permit from the city.

**Issuer Types**

**County Recorders / Registrars of Deeds:** (The ultimate authority).
**Utility Companies:** (Hosting their own "Active Rights" database).
**Title Platforms:** (e.g., Simplifile, DataTrace).

## Competition vs. County Records Search

| Feature | OCR-to-Hash | County Search (Online) | Physical Deed Room |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Bound to the County. | **Database-Bound.** High trust but manual. | **Physical.** Trust the paper. |
| **Speed** | **Instant.** 5-second scan at the fence line. | **Slow.** Requires finding the parcel # and navigating old UIs. | **Very Slow.** Hours of travel/search. |
| **Integrity** | **Binds Content.** Protects the legal text. | **Data-Only.** Doesn't verify the paper in your hand. | **Vulnerable.** |
| **User Access** | **Universal.** Anyone with the document. | **Difficult.** Many counties charge fees or require logins. | **Restricted.** |

**Why OCR wins here:** The "Field Reality." Disputes about property rights happen in backyards and at construction sites. People don't have Libers and Pages memorized. OCR-to-hash turns the **Physical Agreement** into a live digital portal, ending trespassing disputes and title confusion in seconds.
