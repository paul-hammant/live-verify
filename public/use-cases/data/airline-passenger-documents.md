## Data Verified

Passenger name, ticket number, flight details, specific service types (baggage, seat, wifi, meal), fee amounts, total paid, payment method (last 4 digits).

**Document Types:**
- **Baggage Receipt:** Issued at check-in kiosk or drop desk.
- **Seat Upgrade Receipt:** Issued at gate or online.
- **In-Flight Purchase Receipt:** Emailed or printed for food/wifi.
- **Lounge Access Receipt:** Day pass purchase.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`delta.com`) and the receipt details.

**Status Indications:**
- **Valid** — Receipt matches airline records.
- **Refunded** — The fee was refunded (e.g., if the bag was lost or wifi didn't work), invalidating the expense claim.
- **Void** — Transaction cancelled.

## Second-Party Use

The **Passenger** (second party) receives the receipt from the airline (first party), **keeps it**, and may later hand it to third parties for various reasons, or never do so.

**Personal Record:** The passenger has their own verified copy of ancillary purchases. Most of the time, the document sits in their email or expense folder—the verification value is latent, there *if needed*.

**Peace of Mind:** The passenger can confirm at any time that the receipt matches what the airline's system recorded and hasn't been altered since they received it.

**Future Optionality:** If an expense reimbursement is needed or a tax audit arises, the passenger has cryptographic proof ready without needing to contact the airline.

## Third-Party Use

The passenger (second party) may hand the verified document to various third parties:

**Corporate Expense Platforms (Concur, Expensify)**
The platform can scan the receipt hash to confirm validity, flagging duplicates or fakes automatically. "Verified by Delta" adds a trust layer above standard OCR.

**Employers / Finance Teams**
Employees sometimes use "receipt generator" websites to create fake baggage receipts for $50/trip. Verification stops this immediately because the fake receipt won't exist in the airline's database.

**Tax Authorities (IRS/HMRC)**
Verifying that "travel expenses" were actually incurred and not just fabricated for deductions.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Fake Expense" Fraud Problem**

- **Receipt Generators:** Websites that generate realistic-looking receipts for any airline.
- **Double Dipping:** Submitting the same receipt to two different employers (e.g., for a consultant working two jobs).
- **Refund Fraud:** Buying a refundable ticket/service, printing the receipt, claiming the expense, then cancelling/refunding the service. Verification reveals the "Refunded" status.

**Issuer Types (First Party)**

- Airlines (Delta, AA, United, BA, etc.)
- Service Providers (Gogo Inflight, Clear, LoungeBuddy)

**Privacy Salt:** Not required. Airline ancillary receipts contain highly unpredictable variables—unique ticket numbers, specific flight numbers with dates, passenger names, transaction authorization codes, and precise timestamps. These elements combined provide sufficient entropy that enumeration attacks are infeasible. Adding salt would provide no additional security benefit.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing

A jurisdiction may require airlines to retain a **witnessing firm** for regulatory compliance. The witnessing firm:

- Receives all hashes from the airline, and any subsequent changes to the payload as they happen—which may manifest as a new hash, a status change (refunded, void), or even a 404 (record deleted)
- Receives structured content/metadata (ticket numbers, flight numbers, service types, amounts)
- Does **NOT** receive plaintext (passenger names, passport details, payment card numbers)
- Provides an immutable, timestamped audit trail—available to the jurisdiction on demand, to passengers/third parties during disputes, or as expert witness testimony in legal proceedings

This provides:
- **Non-repudiation:** Airline cannot deny issuing the receipt
- **Timestamp proof:** Transaction existed at a specific time
- **Regulatory audit:** Aviation authorities can inspect the witness ledger for fraud patterns
- **Resilience:** Verification works even if airline's systems go down

**Public Blockchain (Non-Party)**

Witnessing firms may periodically commit rollups to an inexpensive public blockchain, providing an ultimate immutability guarantee. The blockchain is a "non-party"—infrastructure, not a participant in the transaction. This creates multiple verification paths:

1. **Airline domain** — Direct check against the issuer
2. **Witnessing firm** — Independent confirmation with timestamp
3. **Public blockchain** — Decentralized trust anchor via rollup inclusion

## Competition vs. Corporate Cards

| Feature | OCR-to-Hash | Corporate Card Feed |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Granularity** | **High.** Shows exactly *what* was bought (Wifi vs Alcohol). | **Low.** Often just shows "DELTA AIR LINES $15.00". |
| **Coverage** | **Universal.** Works for personal cards used for business. | **Limited.** Only works if the employee uses the mandatory corporate card. |
| **Immediacy** | **Instant.** Scan receipt immediately. | **Laggy.** Card feeds can take days to sync. |
| **Cash/Kiosk** | **Yes.** Covers kiosk prints. | **No.** Misses cash or non-integrated payments. |

**Why OCR wins here:** While Level 3 credit card data tries to provide line-item detail, it is notoriously unreliable for travel ancillary fees. A verified receipt provides the definitive "Itemized" proof required by strict expense policies.

## What is an Airline Compensation Letter?

Under regulations like **EU261** (Europe) or similar laws in Canada/UK, airlines must pay cash compensation (up to €600) for delays or cancellations within their control.

However, airlines often deny claims citing "Extraordinary Circumstances" (e.g., Weather, ATC strikes). When this happens, passengers need a formal **Determination Letter** to:
1.  **Claim Travel Insurance:** Insurers won't pay until the airline officially refuses.
2.  **Sue:** Small claims courts need proof of the airline's final position.

Verifying these letters prevents passengers from faking denials to defraud insurers ("Double Dipping").

</div>

## Data Verified

Passenger name, flight number, disruption date, claim reference number, decision (Approved/Denied), compensation amount, regulation cited (EU261, UK261, DOT), payment status.

**Document Types:**
- **Compensation Offer:** Letter confirming payout.
- **Denial Letter:** "Extraordinary Circumstances" rejection (needed for insurance).
- **Delay Verification:** Proof of delay duration (for employer/insurance).

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`ba.com`) and the claim status.

**Status Indications:**
- **Paid** — Compensation was issued.
- **Denied** — Claim rejected (reason provided, e.g., "Weather").
- **Pending** — Under review.

## Second-Party Use

The **Passenger** benefits from verification.

**Travel Insurance Claims:** Insurers often require a "denial letter" from the airline before they will pay out for trip interruption. A verified denial letter proves the airline refused to pay, unlocking the insurance payout.

**Employer Proof:** Proving to a boss that the missed meeting was indeed due to a flight cancellation and not oversleeping.

## Third-Party Use

**Travel Insurers**
**Double-Dipping Prevention:** Fraudsters claim €600 from the airline AND €600 from the insurer for the same delay. Verification allows the insurer to check: "Did the airline pay?" If the status is "Paid," the insurer reduces their payout accordingly.

**Claims Management Companies (e.g., AirHelp)**
**Automated Onboarding:** Instead of asking passengers to forward emails or scan PDFs that need manual review, the agency can scan the verification link to instantly ingest the claim details and validity.

**Small Claims Courts**
**Evidence:** In disputes, a verified letter from the airline admitting fault (or denying it for invalid reasons) is powerful evidence.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Fake Denial" Fraud Problem**

- **Fabricated Denials:** Creating a fake letter from the airline saying "We won't pay because of weather" to trick a travel insurer into paying out (when the airline actually WOULD have paid if asked).
- **Fake Approvals:** Creating a fake offer letter to show a claims agency to get them to take the case (or to borrow money against the expected payout).

**Issuer Types**

**Airlines:** (Ryanair, EasyJet, Lufthansa, etc.)
**ADR Bodies:** (Alternative Dispute Resolution entities like CEDR)

## Competition vs. Email / Portals

| Feature | OCR-to-Hash | Forwarded Email | Airline Portal |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Authenticity** | **Cryptographic.** Sender verified by domain. | **Weak.** Emails are easily edited/spoofed. | **High.** But requires login credentials. |
| **Sharing** | **Easy.** Send the link or paper to insurer. | **Messy.** Forwarding chains, PDF attachments. | **Hard.** Can't give insurer your airline password. |
| **Privacy** | **Selective.** Share only the specific letter. | **Low.** Email headers expose metadata. | **Low.** Portal access exposes full history. |

**Why OCR wins here:** It creates a portable, verifiable "Token of Truth" about a specific claim that can be handed to insurers, lawyers, or employers without sharing login credentials or relying on easily forged emails.

</div>

## Data Verified

Passenger name, original ticket number, refund document number (Credit Memo), refund amount, currency, penalty applied, original form of payment credited, date processed.

**Document Types:**
- **Passenger Receipt (Refund):** Standard notification to passenger.
- **Agency Credit Memo (ACM):** Issued to travel agents.
- **Electronic Miscellaneous Document (EMD):** For ancillary refunds.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`lufthansa.com`) and refund status.

**Status Indications:**
- **Refunded** — Funds released to payment processor.
- **Pending** — Approved but not yet transmitted.
- **Reversed** — Refund cancellation (e.g., if passenger decided to keep the ticket).

## Second-Party Use

The **Passenger** or **Travel Agent** benefits from verification.

**Chargeback Defense:** Proving to a credit card company that a refund was *not* issued yet (or was insufficient), justifying a dispute.

**Reimbursement Correction:** Proving to an employer exactly how much was refunded so the correct amount can be returned to the company.

## Third-Party Use

**Corporate Finance / Audit**
**"Buy and Cancel" Fraud:** An employee buys a refundable Business Class ticket ($5k), expenses it, gets reimbursed. Then they cancel the ticket, get the refund to their personal card. The company is out $5k.
**Solution:** Auditors require verification of the ticket status. If the status is "REFUNDED" or "VOID," the employee must repay the company.

**Travel Management Companies (TMCs)**
**Commission Reconciliation:** Ensuring the airline refunded the correct amount including/excluding agent commissions.

**Tax Authorities**
**VAT Reclamation:** If a ticket was refunded, the input VAT cannot be claimed. Verification ensures tax filings match reality.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Phantom Ticket" Fraud Problem**

- **Photoshop:** Taking a real receipt for a flown flight and editing it to look like a refund (or vice versa).
- **Hidden Refunds:** Employees banking on the fact that Finance doesn't have visibility into their personal credit card refunds.

**Issuer Types**

**Airlines:** (Lufthansa, Air France, Emirates, etc.)
**IATA BSP:** (Bank Settlement Plan) which processes agent refunds.

## Competition vs. Credit Card Statements

| Feature | OCR-to-Hash | Credit Card Statement |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Detail** | **High.** Shows breakdown of tax vs fare vs penalty. | **Low.** Just shows "LUFTHANSA CR EUR 2750". |
| **Privacy** | **High.** Reveals only this transaction. | **Low.** Employee must share full bank statement (revealing personal spending) to prove the refund. |
| **Timeliness** | **Instant.** Available as soon as airline processes. | **Slow.** Refunds can take 3-10 days to appear on statements. |

**Why OCR wins here:** Privacy. Employees hate sharing their personal bank statements with Finance to prove a negative (or a positive). A verified document from the airline allows them to prove the refund details without exposing their entire financial life.

<span data-verify-line="upgrade">verify:united.com/receipts/v/x9y8z7</span> <span verifiable-text="end" data-for="upgrade">]</span></pre>
</div>

## Data Verified

Passenger name, original ticket number, confirmation code, flight details, from/to class of service, cash payment amount, miles redeemed, date of transaction.

**Document Types:**
- **Cash Upgrade Receipt:** Paid fully in cash/card at check-in.
- **Mileage Upgrade Award:** Receipt showing miles + co-pay.
- **Complimentary Upgrade Notice:** Elite status upgrade (usually $0 value).

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`united.com`) and the upgrade validity.

**Status Indications:**
- **Confirmed** — Upgrade was processed and paid.
- **Refunded** — Passenger cancelled or was downgraded (e.g., equipment swap).
- **Waitlisted** — Request made but not yet cleared (not a valid receipt for expense yet).

## Second-Party Use

The **Business Traveler** benefits from verification.

**Expense Justification:** Proving to an employer that the $550 charge was for a *policy-compliant* upgrade (e.g., "flights over 8 hours") and not an unauthorized splurge.

**Tax Records:** Differentiating between business expenses (the cash co-pay) and personal costs (using personal miles), which can be complex for tax deductions.

## Third-Party Use

**Corporate Finance / Auditors**
**Policy Compliance:** Companies often have strict rules: "We pay for Economy, you can upgrade with your own points." A receipt showing "$5,000" for a Business Class ticket looks suspicious. A verified receipt showing "Economy Fare + $0 Upgrade (Miles)" clarifies that the company only paid for the base fare.

**Project Clients**
**Billable Expenses:** Consultants billing travel to clients need indisputable proof of costs. Clients often reject "Business Class" invoices. A verified receipt showing the breakdown (Base Fare vs Upgrade) allows the consultant to bill the Base Fare to the client while absorbing the upgrade cost personally.

**Travel Management Companies (TMCs)**
**Spend Tracking:** Ensuring that "invisible" spend (upgrades bought directly from the airline app, bypassing the TMC) is captured in total travel cost reporting.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Fake Upgrade" Fraud Problem**

- **Photoshop:** Editing an Economy receipt to look like a Business Class ticket to claim a higher reimbursement.
- **Refund Schemes:** Buying a fully refundable First Class ticket, printing the receipt, expensing it, then refunding it and flying Economy. Verification reveals the "Refunded" status.

**Issuer Types**

**Airlines:** (United, American, Delta, Emirates, etc.)
**Upgrade Auctions:** (Plusgrade) third-party platforms used by many airlines for bidding on upgrades.

## Competition vs. Credit Card Statements

| Feature | OCR-to-Hash | Credit Card Statement |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Granularity** | **High.** Shows "Upgrade SFO-LHR" distinct from "Baggage". | **Low.** Just shows "UNITED AIRLINES $550". |
| **Context** | **Full.** Shows Class of Service (Economy -> Business). | **None.** No flight details or class info. |
| **Mileage Info** | **Yes.** Shows miles burned (crucial for value calculations). | **No.** Only shows cash. |

**Why OCR wins here:** Credit card statements are too vague for strict corporate travel policies. They prove *payment* but not *product*. A verified receipt proves exactly *what* was purchased, preventing policy violations disguised as generic airline charges.

## Data Verified

Member name, lounge name/location, date/time of entry, number of guests, total fee charged, visit reference ID.

**Document Types:**
- **Visit Receipt:** Email/printout after entry.
- **Day Pass Purchase:** Receipt for buying a one-time pass (e.g., United Club one-time pass).
- **Membership Renewal:** Annual fee receipt.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`prioritypass.com`, `loungekey.com`, `amex.com`) and transaction status.

**Status Indications:**
- **Valid** — Visit confirmed and billed.
- **Comped** — Visit verified but fee waived (important for expenses).
- **Void** — Transaction cancelled/refunded.

## Second-Party Use

The **Business Traveler** benefits from verification.

**Expense Reimbursement:** Proving that the $64 charge was for "Client Entertainment" (guests brought into the lounge) rather than personal indulgence.

**Billing Disputes:** Proving you didn't enter the lounge if charged erroneously (e.g., "I was at the gate, here is my boarding pass scan time").

## Third-Party Use

**Employers / Finance Teams**
**Policy Compliance:** Many companies pay for the employee's entry but *not* for guests (unless they are clients). A verified receipt showing "Guests: 2" allows Finance to ask "Who were these guests?" and verify client meetings.

**Tax Authorities**
**Deductibility:** Lounge access can be a business expense, but "lavish or extravagant" entertainment is scrutinized. Verified receipts provide the audit trail needed.

**Project Clients**
**Re-billing:** If a consultant charges lounge access to a client project, the client demands proof. Verified receipts prevent "padding" the invoice with personal relaxation costs.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Phantom Guest" Fraud Problem**

- **Padding Expenses:** Changing "Guests: 0" to "Guests: 2" on a PDF receipt to claim an extra $64 reimbursement.
- **Fake Receipts:** Using a template to create a lounge receipt for a trip where the traveler actually sat at the gate.

**Issuer Types**

**Networks:** (Priority Pass, LoungeKey, DragonPass)
**Airlines:** (Admirals Club, SkyClub, United Club)
**Credit Cards:** (Amex Centurion)

## Competition vs. Credit Card Statements

| Feature | OCR-to-Hash | Credit Card Statement |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Guest Detail** | **High.** Shows "Guests: 2". | **None.** Just shows "$64.00". |
| **Location** | **Exact.** "The Club at SJC". | **Vague.** "PRIORITY PASS HONG KONG". |
| **Time** | **Exact.** Proves you were there during the delay. | **Date Only.** |

**Why OCR wins here:** Context. A credit card charge is just a number. A verified lounge receipt proves *who* was with you and *where* you were, turning a generic charge into a justifiable business expense.
