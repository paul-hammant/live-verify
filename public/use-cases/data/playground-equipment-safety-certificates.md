## What are Playground Safety Certificates?

In schools and public parks, every slide, swing, and climbing frame is a potential high-velocity hazard. A **Playground Safety Compliance Certificate** proves that a "Certified Playground Safety Inspector" (CPSI) has audited the equipment for "Entrapment Zones" (where a child's head could get stuck) and "Surface Attenuation" (ensuring the rubber or woodchips are soft enough to prevent a brain injury after a fall).

These documents are the "Shield of Public Trust." Fraud is high-stakes: un-certified vendors or negligent landlords often "pencil whip" a safety check, creating fake PDFs for equipment that hasn't been tested in years to avoid the high cost of surfacing replacement. In high-risk zones, a fake certificate can lead to preventable traumatic injuries. Verified hashes bind the **Equipment Serial Numbers, Surface Test Results (HIC), and Inspector ID** to the city's or the inspector's domain (e.g., `parks.city.gov` or `nrpa.org`).

## Data Verified

Equipment serial number, site/park name, specific structure name (e.g., "The Castle"), surface type (e.g., Poured Rubber, Woodchips), HIC (Head Injury Criterion) score, ASTM F1487 status, CPSI (Certified Playground Safety Inspector) ID, inspection date, expiration date, issuing department.

**Document Types:**
- **Annual Safety Audit:** The detailed multi-page compliance report.
- **Surface Impact Certificate:** Proof the "floor" is soft enough.
- **ADA Access Certificate:** Proving the site is inclusive.
- **Red Tag Notice:** (Linked hash) marking a specific structure as "Out of Use."

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`parks.city.gov`, `nrpa.org`, `cpsc.gov`) and the equipment standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Safe / Certified** — Equipment is current and passed all safety checks.
- **Closed / Red Tagged** — **CRITICAL:** A serious safety hazard was found; structure is unsafe.
- **Expired** — **ALERT:** Mandatory annual audit is overdue; use at own risk.
- **Surface Low** — **ALERT:** Attenuation material (e.g., woodchips) needs refill.

## Second-Party Use

The **Park Director / School Principal** benefits from verification.

**Liability Protection:** If a child is injured on a slide, the school can provide the verified hash of their "Annual Safety Audit." "Verified by Parks & Rec" ensures the insurer and the court that the school met the "Duty of Care" required by law, defending against millions in "Gross Negligence" claims.

**Maintenance Audit:** The principal can scan the tags left by their maintenance sub-contractors. Verification ensures the contractor actually performed the "Head Probe" tests and didn't just sign a piece of paper in their truck.

## Third-Party Use

**Parents / PTA**
**Public Safety Audit:** A concerned parent can scan the placard on the fence. If the hash returns **"EXPIRED"** or **"SURFACE LOW,"** they have the verified evidence needed to demand immediate maintenance before an injury occurs.

**City Risk Managers**
**Portfolio Vetting:** Automatically monitoring the safety status of 500 city playgrounds. If any structure's hash returns **"RED TAGGED,"** the manager can instantly dispatch a repair crew and notify the city's legal department.

**Insurance Loss Adjusters**
**Incident Forensics:** After a traumatic fall, the insurer verifies the original HIC scores from the last inspection. Verification ensures the surfacing met safety standards at the time of the accident.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Paper Safety" Fraud Problem**

- **Pencil Whipping:** Signing a safety tag today but dating it "Yesterday" to satisfy a quarterly quota.
- **Surface Faking:** Editing a failed HIC score of "1200" (Unsafe) to "800" (Safe) on a PDF report.
- **Logo Mimicry:** Using a CPSI's branding on a fake certificate for equipment that was never inspected.

**Issuer Types**

**Municipal Parks Departments.**
**National Recreation and Park Association (NRPA).**
**Private Playground Safety Consulting Firms.**

**Privacy Salt:** Low. Playground safety data is a matter of public record. However, individual inspector home contact info should be salted to protect professional privacy.

## Rationale

Playground safety is a "No-Failure" domain. By turning static placards into live digital bridges, we ensure that the "Protection" beneath a child's feet is backed by cryptographic proof, protecting the public from the high cost of un-vetted safety equipment.
