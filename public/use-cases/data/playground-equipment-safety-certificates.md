## What are Playground Safety Certificates?

In schools and public parks, every slide, swing, and climbing frame is a potential high-velocity hazard. A **Playground Safety Compliance Certificate** proves that a "Certified Playground Safety Inspector" (CPSI) has audited the equipment for "Entrapment Zones" (where a child's head could get stuck) and "Surface Attenuation" (ensuring the rubber or woodchips are soft enough to prevent a brain injury after a fall).

These documents are the "Shield of Public Trust." Fraud is high-stakes: un-certified vendors or negligent landlords often "pencil whip" a safety check, creating fake PDFs for equipment that hasn't been tested in years to avoid the high cost of surfacing replacement. In high-risk zones, a fake certificate can lead to preventable traumatic injuries. Verified hashes bind the **Equipment Serial Numbers, Surface Test Results (HIC), and Inspector ID** to the city's or the inspector's domain (e.g., `parks.city.gov` or `nrpa.org`).

## Data Verified

Equipment serial number, site/park name, specific structure name (e.g., "The Castle"), surface type (e.g., Poured Rubber, Woodchips), HIC (Head Injury Criterion) score, ASTM F1487 status, CPSI (Certified Playground Safety Inspector) ID, inspection date, expiration date, issuing department.

**Document Types:**
- **Annual Safety Audit:** The detailed multi-page compliance report.
- **Surface Impact Certificate:** Proof the "floor" is soft enough.
- **ADA Access Certificate:** Proving the site is inclusive.
- **Red Tag Notice:** (Linked hash) marking a specific structure as "Out of Use."

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`parks.city.gov`, `nrpa.org`, `cpsc.gov`) and the equipment standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Safe / Certified** — Equipment is current and passed all safety checks.
- **Closed / Red Tagged** — **CRITICAL:** A serious safety hazard was found; structure is unsafe.
- **Expired** — **ALERT:** Mandatory annual audit is overdue; use at own risk.
- **Surface Low** — **ALERT:** Attenuation material (e.g., woodchips) needs refill.

## Second-Party Use

The **Park Director / School Principal** (second party) receives the safety certificate from the inspector or parks department (first party), **keeps it**, and may later hand it to third parties for various reasons, or never do so.

**Personal Record:** They have their own verified copy of the safety audit results. Most of the time, the document sits in their compliance files—the verification value is latent, there *if needed*.

**Peace of Mind:** They can confirm at any time that the certificate matches what the inspector's system recorded and hasn't been altered.

**Future Optionality:** If a child is injured or an inspection is challenged, they have cryptographic proof ready without needing to contact the inspector or city department.

## Third-Party Use

The park director / school principal (second party) may hand the verified document to various third parties:

**Parents / PTA**
**Public Safety Audit:** A concerned parent can scan the placard on the fence. If the hash returns **"EXPIRED"** or **"SURFACE LOW,"** they have the verified evidence needed to demand immediate maintenance before an injury occurs.

**City Risk Managers**
**Portfolio Vetting:** Automatically monitoring the safety status of 500 city playgrounds. If any structure's hash returns **"RED TAGGED,"** the manager can instantly dispatch a repair crew and notify the city's legal department.

**Insurance Loss Adjusters**
**Incident Forensics:** After a traumatic fall, the insurer verifies the original HIC scores from the last inspection. Verification ensures the surfacing met safety standards at the time of the accident.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Paper Safety" Fraud Problem**

- **Pencil Whipping:** Signing a safety tag today but dating it "Yesterday" to satisfy a quarterly quota.
- **Surface Faking:** Editing a failed HIC score of "1200" (Unsafe) to "800" (Safe) on a PDF report.
- **Logo Mimicry:** Using a CPSI's branding on a fake certificate for equipment that was never inspected.

**Issuer Types (First Party)**

- Municipal Parks Departments
- National Recreation and Park Association (NRPA)
- Private Playground Safety Consulting Firms

**Privacy Salt:** Not required. Playground safety certificates contain many unpredictable variables that combine to create high entropy: unique structure IDs, specific park locations, inspector license numbers, exact HIC test scores (with decimal precision), and inspection dates. Playground safety data is a matter of public record, and the combination of these unique identifiers makes brute-force enumeration infeasible without salt.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing

A jurisdiction may require parks departments and inspection firms to retain a **witnessing firm** for regulatory compliance. The witnessing firm:

- Receives all hashes from the inspector, and any subsequent changes to the payload as they happen—which may manifest as a new hash, a status change (closed, red tagged, expired), or even a 404 (record deleted)
- Receives structured content/metadata (structure IDs, HIC scores, compliance statuses, inspection dates)
- Does **NOT** receive plaintext (inspector home addresses, internal maintenance notes)
- Provides an immutable, timestamped audit trail—available to the jurisdiction on demand, to park directors/third parties during disputes, or as expert witness testimony in legal proceedings

This provides:
- **Non-repudiation:** Inspector cannot deny issuing the safety certificate
- **Timestamp proof:** Hash existed at a specific time
- **Regulatory audit:** CPSC can inspect the witness ledger for safety compliance patterns
- **Resilience:** Verification works even if city's systems go down

**Public Blockchain (Non-Party)**

Witnessing firms may periodically commit rollups to an inexpensive public blockchain, providing an ultimate immutability guarantee. The blockchain is a "non-party"—infrastructure, not a participant in the transaction. This creates multiple verification paths:

1. **Parks department domain** — Direct check against the issuer
2. **Witnessing firm** — Independent confirmation with timestamp
3. **Public blockchain** — Decentralized trust anchor via rollup inclusion

## Rationale

Playground safety is a "No-Failure" domain. By turning static placards into live digital bridges, we ensure that the "Protection" beneath a child's feet is backed by cryptographic proof, protecting the public from the high cost of un-vetted safety equipment.
