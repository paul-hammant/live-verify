## What is a Playground Certificate?

Every slide, swing, and climbing frame in a public park or school must be inspected for safety. The **Certificate of Compliance** proves that a "Certified Playground Safety Inspector" (CPSI) has verified that the equipment won't trap a child's head or cause a fall onto hard concrete.

By law, these certificates must be on file at the park office.

Fraud is high-stakes here: unscrupulous equipment vendors sometimes provide fake "safety papers" for cheap, un-vetted swingsets to win city contracts. Verified hashes allow parents and park rangers to scan the sticker on the equipment and see the **verified inspection date and pass status** from the inspector's own domain.

**Certificate Variations:** Multiple certificate types or levels may exist.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain and the responder text (e.g., "Valid ID" or "Denied").

**Status Indications:**
- **Valid** - Document verified and current
- **Expired** - Document has reached expiration
- **Revoked** - Document has been revoked or cancelled
- **Superseded** - A newer version exists

The verification response may include additional context such as issue date, expiration date, or document serial numbers.

## Second-Party Use

The document holder (subject/recipient) benefits from verification.

**Authenticity Confirmation:** Verify certificate after receipt to confirm it's genuine.

**Credential Display:** Present verified credentials to employers or clients.

**Professional Development:** Track verified certifications for career advancement.

**Compliance Documentation:** Maintain verified certificates for regulatory requirements.

**Renewal Planning:** Monitor certification status to avoid expiration.

## Third-Party Use

**Auditors and Compliance Officers**

Internal and external audits:

**Financial Audits:** Verify documents during financial statement audits.

**Compliance Audits:** Validate documentation for regulatory compliance.

**Internal Controls:** Test document authenticity in control assessments.

**Fraud Investigations:** Verify documents in fraud examinations.

**Third-Party Audits:** Validate vendor and partner documentation.

## Verification Architecture

**The Playground equipment safety inspection certificates Fraud Problem**

Document fraud creates significant risks:

- **Fabrication:** Entirely fake documents created from scratch
- **Alteration:** Genuine documents with modified content (dates, amounts, names)
- **Impersonation:** Documents falsely claiming to be from legitimate issuers
- **Expired/Revoked Documents:** Presenting invalid documents as current

OCR-to-hash verification addresses fake and altered documents. Domain binding confirms the claimed issuer actually issued the document.

**Issuer Types**

Who issues these documents and operates verification endpoints?

**Primary Issuers:** Organizations with direct authority to issue these documents.

**Licensed Professionals:** Professionals authorized to create and certify documents.

**Government Agencies:** Federal, state, or local agencies with jurisdiction.

**Industry Bodies:** Trade associations and professional organizations.

**System Integration**

Verification integrates with relevant systems:

**Issuer Systems:** Core operational systems generate verification hashes at document creation.

**Industry Standards:** Existing data standards extended to include verification.

**Regulatory Systems:** Government databases for systematic hash receipt and oversight.

**Third-Party Platforms:** Industry portals and platforms enable verification access.

## Rationale

Prevents fake playground certificates. Domain binding verifies certified inspector (CPSI). ASTM F1487/CPSC guidelines compliance. Prevents child injury liability. Parks department requirement.
