## Verification Value

**Problem:** Unauthorized events and fake permits:
- Unlicensed events claiming city approval
- Fake permits to occupy public space
- Exceeded scope (larger crowd, louder music than permitted)
- Fraudulent film permits for trespassing

**Solution:** Police, neighbors, and city officials can verify events have genuine permits. Residents can confirm a block party or film shoot is actually authorized.
