## What are Tax and Wage Statements?

In the US and many other nations, the **W-2 Wage and Tax Statement** (or its equivalent, like the P60 in the UK) is the official record of your annual income and the taxes withheld by your employer. It is the "Anchor of Truth" for your financial life.

Lenders use W-2s to approve mortgages, and tax authorities use them to verify your tax return. Fraud is rampant: criminals create "Synthetic W-2s" to claim fraudulent tax refunds, or they "edit" a real W-2 to inflate their income to qualify for a luxury home loan. Verified hashes bind the **Employee SSN, Total Wages, and Employer EIN** to the payroll provider's or the tax agency's domain (e.g., `adp.com`, `gusto.com`, or `irs.gov`).

Employer EIN, employer name, employee SSN (masked), employee name, tax year, total wages/tips, federal tax withheld, state tax withheld, Medicare/Social Security wages, control number, payroll provider ID.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`adp.com`, `gusto.com`, `irs.gov`) and the filing standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Verified / Filed** — The record matches the official government and payroll data.
- **Corrected (W-2c)** — **ALERT:** An error was found; this version is void.
- **Unknown** — **CRITICAL:** Hash not found; high risk of "Synthetic W-2" fraud.
- **Amended** — A newer version of the tax return exists.

## Second-Party Use

The **Employee / Taxpayer** benefits from verification.

**Mortgage Approval Speed:** When applying for a loan, the employee shows the verified hash of their W-2. The lender can instantly see **"VERIFIED INCOME: $145,000"** from a trusted provider like ADP, bypassing the 3-day "Manual Employer Verification" call and getting the loan approved in minutes.

**Audit Protection:** A taxpayer can maintain a verified digital library of all past W-2s. During a tax audit, they can provide the verified hashes to the IRS to prove their income wasn't "fabricated" using a home printer.

## Third-Party Use

**Mortgage Lenders / Banks**
**Zero-Trust Underwriting:** Thousands of fake W-2s are submitted to banks every month. OCR-to-hash connects the underwriter directly to the payroll provider's domain, stopping "Income Inflation" fraud at the source and reducing loan default rates.

**Tax Authorities (IRS / State)**
**Refund Fraud Prevention:** Before issuing a $5,000 refund, the IRS scans the verified hash of the W-2 provided by the taxpayer. If it returns **"NOT FOUND"** or **"WAGES: $0,"** the refund is blocked, stopping "Identity Theft Refund Fraud" (ITRF).

**HR & Recruiting Firms**
**Background Vetting:** Verifying that a candidate's "Previous Salary" claim is an accurate, tax-reported fact rather than a negotiation fabrication.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Synthetic Income" Fraud Problem**

- **Income Padding:** Editing a $45,000 W-2 to read $145,000 to qualify for a larger credit limit.
- **Ghost Employers:** Creating a fake company EIN and printing W-2s for a person who never worked there.
- **Filing Omission:** Submitting a W-2 to a bank that was never actually filed with the IRS.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**Payroll Processors (ADP, Workday, Gusto).**
**National Tax Agencies (IRS, HMRC).**
**Large Corporate HR Portals.**

**Privacy Salt:** EXTREMELY CRITICAL. Tax data is governed by strict privacy laws (Section 6103 in the US). The hash MUST be salted to prevent "Mass Income Scraping" of the tax-paying population.

## Rationale

Tax forms are the "Financial DNA" of a citizen. By turning wage statements into verifiable digital bridges, we protect the mortgage market from defaults and the government from the multi-billion dollar cost of refund fraud.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing

A jurisdiction may require the issuer to retain a **witnessing firm** for regulatory compliance. The witnessing firm:

- Receives all hashes from the issuer, and any subsequent changes to the payload as they happen—which may manifest as a new hash, a status change, or even a 404 (record deleted)
- Receives structured content/metadata (key identifiers and dates)
- Does **NOT** receive plaintext or sensitive personal information
- Provides an immutable, timestamped audit trail—available to the jurisdiction on demand, to document holders/third parties during disputes, or as expert witness testimony in legal proceedings

This provides:
- **Non-repudiation:** Issuer cannot deny issuing the document
- **Timestamp proof:** Document existed at a specific time
- **Regulatory audit:** Jurisdictions can inspect the witness ledger for fraud detection
- **Resilience:** Verification works even if issuer's systems go down

**Public Blockchain (Non-Party)**

Witnessing firms may periodically commit rollups to an inexpensive public blockchain, providing an ultimate immutability guarantee. The blockchain is a "non-party"—infrastructure, not a participant in the transaction. This creates multiple verification paths:

1. **Issuer domain** — Direct check against the issuer
2. **Witnessing firm** — Independent confirmation with timestamp
3. **Public blockchain** — Decentralized trust anchor via rollup inclusion
