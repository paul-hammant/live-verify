## What is an Authority-Issued Driving Record?

A **driving record** is an official statement from the licensing authority (DVLA, DMV, etc.) showing a driver's current status: penalty points, endorsements, disqualifications, licence categories, and validity.

Unlike a self-declaration ("I have no points"), an authority-issued record is **ground truth** — the authority confirms the actual state of the licence at that moment.

## Who Verifies Driving Records

| Verifier | When | Why |
|----------|------|-----|
| **Employers (fleet/delivery)** | Hiring + periodic checks | Insurance requires clean drivers; liability for unfit drivers |
| **Car rental companies** | Before rental | Won't rent to disqualified or high-risk drivers |
| **Insurance underwriters** | Policy inception + renewal | Points affect premium; undisclosed points void policy |
| **Ride-share platforms** | Driver onboarding + periodic | Platform liability; passenger safety |
| **Taxi/PHV licensing** | Licence application + renewal | Local authority requirement |
| **Commercial operators** | CPC compliance, O-licence | Transport regulator requirement |
| **Company car schemes** | Eligibility check | Corporate policy on driver fitness |

## The Self-Declaration Problem

| Approach | Problem |
|----------|---------|
| **Driver says "I have no points"** | Could be lying; no verification |
| **Employer checks DVLA annually** | Points acquired between checks unknown |
| **Driver signs declaration form** | Proves they signed, not that it's true |
| **Insurance asks "any points?"** | Incentive to under-report; fraud |

**OCR-to-hash solves:** Authority issues verifiable record → driver presents to employer/insurer → recipient scans → confirms genuine and current.

## Data Verified

**Licence holder name**, **licence number**, **record date/time**, **penalty points total**, **endorsement codes and dates**, **disqualification status**, **licence categories held**, **category validity dates**.

## Data Visible After Verification

**Status Indications:**
- **Valid - Clean** — No points, no endorsements, no restrictions
- **Valid - Points** — Active endorsements on licence
- **Valid - Expired Points** — Historical endorsements (points served)
- **Disqualified** — Currently banned from driving
- **Revoked** — Licence cancelled (new driver points, medical, etc.)
- **Expired** — Licence needs renewal

## Use Case: Fleet Employer

**Scenario:** Delivery company with 200 drivers. Insurance requires all drivers to have fewer than 9 points.

**Current process:**
1. Annual DVLA check on all drivers (batch, costs per check)
2. Drivers sign quarterly declaration "I have not acquired points"
3. If driver lies, company only finds out at next annual check
4. Insurance claim denied if undisclosed points

**With OCR-to-hash:**
1. Monthly: Drivers obtain fresh driving record from DVLA
2. Driver presents to fleet manager (paper or screen)
3. Fleet manager scans → verified → record logged
4. Driver with undisclosed points can't produce clean verification
5. Real-time visibility, not annual snapshots

## Use Case: Car Rental

**Scenario:** Customer rents vehicle. Rental company needs to verify valid licence and acceptable record.

**Current process:**
1. Customer shows plastic licence
2. Staff checks photo, categories, expiry
3. No visibility of points or disqualifications (not on card)
4. UK: Can use DVLA check code (customer generates online)
5. Foreign licences: Often no way to verify

**With OCR-to-hash:**
1. Customer obtains driving record before rental
2. Presents at counter (paper or phone)
3. Staff scans → sees points, categories, validity
4. Rental decision based on verified record
5. For foreign licences: If issuing country participates, same flow

## Use Case: Insurance Application

**Scenario:** Customer applies for motor insurance. Premium depends on driving history.

**Current process:**
1. Application asks "how many points do you have?"
2. Customer may under-report (fraud, or genuinely forgotten)
3. Insurer relies on declaration + random DVLA checks
4. At claim time: If undisclosed points, policy may be void

**With OCR-to-hash:**
1. Application requires verified driving record
2. Customer obtains from DVLA, submits with application
3. Underwriter scans → verified → accurate risk assessment
4. No ambiguity about what was disclosed
5. Renewal: Fresh record required

## Jurisdiction Differences

| Jurisdiction | Authority | Current Access | OCR-to-Hash Opportunity |
|--------------|-----------|----------------|------------------------|
| **UK** | DVLA | Share Driving Licence (code, 21 days) | Replace code with scannable document |
| **US** | State DMVs | Varies; MVR requests (fee, delay) | Standardize with verifiable record |
| **EU** | National authorities | Varies by country | Mutual recognition with verification |
| **Australia** | State transport depts | Demerit point checks | Verifiable record for employers |

## Privacy Considerations

**What the record shows:**
- Points and endorsements (relevant to driving fitness)
- Licence categories (relevant to vehicle operation)
- Validity status

**What the record should NOT show:**
- Address (not relevant to driving fitness)
- Medical conditions (unless affecting categories)
- Unspent convictions unrelated to driving

**Consent model:** Driver requests their own record, chooses when/whether to share. Authority doesn't push records to third parties — driver controls disclosure.

## The "Stale Record" Problem

Driving records are **point-in-time**. Driver could:
- Get points the day after obtaining clean record
- Present "clean" record that's now outdated
- Acquire disqualification between checks

**Mitigations:**
- Record shows issue date — recipients can require freshness (e.g., within 7 days)
- Frequent re-verification for high-risk roles (commercial drivers)
- Future: Subscription-based alerts when status changes (requires driver consent)

## Verification Architecture

**The Problem:**
- Self-declarations are unreliable
- Periodic batch checks miss interim changes
- Plastic licence card shows categories but not points
- DVLA check codes are clunky (enter code on website, not scannable)

**The Fix:** DVLA/DMV issues scannable driving record. Driver obtains on demand. Third party scans verification URL → confirmed by authority domain.

**Why the authority must issue:**
- Only DVLA/DMV knows actual points and status
- Self-declarations prove nothing
- Third-party scrapers are unreliable and may violate terms
