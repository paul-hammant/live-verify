## What is a Salon License?

To cut hair or perform skin treatments (like chemical peels), a person must be licensed by the **State Board of Cosmetology**.

This license isn't just about fashion; it's about **Health**. It proves the stylist knows how to properly disinfect tools to prevent the spread of infections, lice, or diseases like Hepatitis.

Stylists are required by law to post their license at their station. Some people use "License Swapping"—using a friend's physical card—to hide that they never passed the health exam. OCR-to-hash allows a customer to scan the badge and see the verified photo and status from the state board instantly.

## Data Verified

Licensee name, photo (hash), license number, license type (Cosmetologist, Barber, Esthetician, Manicurist), expiration date, disciplinary history flag, issuing state board.

**Document Types:**
- **Practitioner License:** Posted at the individual's chair.
- **Establishment License:** For the salon/shop itself.
- **Instructional License:** For teachers in beauty schools.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`barbercosmo.ca.gov`, `dos.ny.gov`) and current standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Active** — License is valid and in good standing.
- **Probationary** — Valid but under state board supervision.
- **Suspended** — Temporarily prohibited from practicing (e.g., sanitation violations).
- **Revoked** — Permanently barred from the profession.

## Second-Party Use

The **Practitioner** benefits from verification.

**Employment Portability:** Proving to a new salon owner that their "Active License" claim is verified by the state. This separates the professional from "Unlicensed Kitchen Cutters" who try to work in salons without a background check or sanitation training.

**Insurance Compliance:** Proving to a professional liability insurer that their license is active to maintain malpractice coverage.

## Third-Party Use

**Salon Customers**
**Public Safety:** Before getting a chemical peel or a straight-razor shave, a customer can scan the license at the station. "Verified by State Board" provides instant assurance that the person has passed the mandatory health and sanitation exams.

**State Board Inspectors**
**Field Enforcement:** Inspectors can walk through a salon scanning lanyards/badges. If a practitioner has been "Suspended" for a safety violation yesterday, the inspector will see it instantly, preventing unsafe services.

**Department of Health**
**Sanitation Audits:** Verifying that all practitioners in a facility are current on their health training to prevent outbreaks of skin infections or communicable diseases.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Fake Stylist" Fraud Problem**

- **License Swapping:** An unlicensed person using a friend's physical license and relying on customers not looking closely at the photo.
- **Expired Display:** Leaving last year's license on the wall to avoid renewal fees and background checks.
- **Sanitation Concealment:** Continuing to work after the Board has suspended the license for "Unsanitary Tools" or "Dirty Foot-baths."

**Issuer Types**

**State Boards of Cosmetology & Barbering:** (e.g., California BBC, Texas TDLR).
**State Departments of Licensing.**

## Competition vs. Window Stickers / Public Lookup

| Feature | OCR-to-Hash | Window/Wall Sticker | State Website Lookup |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Bound to the Board. | **Mechanical.** Hard to forge, but non-verifiable. | **High.** Direct DB access. |
| **Speed** | **Instant.** 5-second scan at the chair. | **N/A.** Just looking. | **Slow.** Type in license #, navigate mobile results. |
| **Integrity** | **Binds Identity.** Links face to status. | **Zero.** Easily swapped. | **None.** |
| **User Privacy** | **Targeted.** Verifies *this* person. | **Open.** | **Open.** Scrape-able by data brokers. |

**Why OCR wins here:** The "Service Point" reality. Customers are already sitting in the chair when they decide to trust a stylist. They won't type license numbers into a state portal while wearing a salon cape. OCR-to-hash turns the **Station License** into a live "Safety Beacon," ensuring trust is verified at the moment of highest risk.
