# Compensation & Conflict-of-Interest Disclosures

When someone advises you on a major financial, medical, or legal decision, you want to know: **Are they being paid to steer me somewhere?** This use case covers verified disclosures of both positive compensation ("I earn X%") and negative attestations ("I receive nothing from third parties").

## The Core Problem

Trust professionals routinely claim to be "independent," "unbiased," or "working only for you." But how do you verify that?

- **The financial advisor** who says "I'm fee-only" but quietly receives revenue-sharing from the funds he recommends
- **The doctor** who says she has "no pharma relationships" but gets $40,000/year from a drug company for "consulting"
- **The insurance broker** who says "I shop all carriers" but gets triple commission from the one he always recommends
- **The procurement officer** who selects vendors while undisclosed family members own those vendors

Currently, these claims are unverifiable. Disclosures exist in fine print or regulatory filings that nobody reads. OCR-to-hash changes this by making conflict disclosures **instant-verifiable** at the point of decision.

## Type 1: Positive Disclosures ("Here's What I Earn")

<div style="max-width: 600px; margin: 24px auto; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif; border: 1px solid #2c5aa0; background: #fff; padding: 0;">

### Data Verified

**Advisor Name**, **Firm Name**, **Disclosure Date**, **Fee Structure** (AUM, flat, hourly), **Revenue Sharing Arrangements**, **Commissions by Product Type**, **Referral Fees**, **Soft Dollar Arrangements**.

### Data Visible After Verification

**Status Indications:**
- **Current** — Disclosure is up-to-date
- **Superseded** — A newer disclosure exists (link provided)
- **Amended** — Material changes since original date
- **Revoked** — Advisor no longer with firm

### Why Verification Matters

Advisors are already required to disclose compensation (Form CRS, Form ADV Part 2A). But these documents are:
- Buried in 30-page PDFs nobody reads
- Delivered once at onboarding, never updated
- Written in legalese designed to obscure, not inform

Verified disclosures make the information **scannable at the point of decision**. When the advisor recommends a specific fund, the client can verify: "Does he get paid extra for this one?"

## The "Payer-as-Fact-Checker" Model

Here's the novel insight: **Who verifies a "$0 received" claim?**

You can't just take someone's word for it. But you can ask the entities that *would have paid* to confirm they *didn't*.

<div style="max-width: 600px; margin: 24px auto; font-family: 'Courier New', monospace; border: 1px solid #444; background: #fafafa; padding: 20px;">
  <div style="font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 15px; border-bottom: 1px solid #444; padding-bottom: 10px;">
    THIRD-PARTY PAYMENT CONFIRMATIONS
  </div>
  <div style="font-size: 0.85em; line-height: 1.8;">
    <p><strong>Re:</strong> Dr. Sarah Chen, MD (NPI: 1234567890)</p>
    <p verifiable-text="start" data-for="compensationconflict"><span>[</span><strong>Period:</strong> Calendar Year 2025</p>
<div style="margin: 15px 0; padding: 10px; background: #fff; border: 1px dashed #666;">
      <p style="margin: 0;"><strong>Pfizer Inc.</strong> — $0.00 paid</p>
      <p style="margin: 5px 0;"><strong>Merck & Co.</strong> — $0.00 paid</p>
      <p style="margin: 5px 0;"><strong>Johnson & Johnson</strong> — $0.00 paid</p>
      <p style="margin: 5px 0;"><strong>AbbVie Inc.</strong> — $0.00 paid</p>
      <p style="margin: 5px 0;"><em>[+ 47 other manufacturers queried]</em></p>
    </div>
<p style="font-size: 0.8em; color: #666;">Data aggregated from CMS Open Payments and direct issuer attestations.</p>
<div style="margin-top: 15px; font-size: 0.8em; text-align: center; color: #888;">
      <div data-verify-line="compensationconflict" style="border-top: 1px dashed #999; margin-top: 30px; padding-top: 10px; font-family: 'Courier New', monospace; font-size: 0.75em; color: #555; text-align: center;"

      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

### How It Works

**1. Individual Makes Attestation**
"I receive $0 from pharmaceutical companies."

**2. Payers Confirm (or Contradict)**
Each pharmaceutical company (via CMS Open Payments or direct API) confirms: "We paid Dr. Chen $0 in 2025."

**3. Aggregator Issues Verification**
A verification service (could be CMS, could be a private registry) aggregates these confirmations and issues a verifiable attestation.

**4. Any Contradiction Voids the Certificate**
If Pfizer says "$0" but Merck shows "$5,000 consulting fee," the attestation fails.

### Who Are the Payers/Fact-Checkers?

| Professional | Entities That Would Pay Them |
|--------------|------------------------------|
| Doctor | Pharma companies, device makers, hospital systems |
| Financial Advisor | Fund companies, insurance carriers, referral networks |
| Insurance Broker | Insurance carriers (commission records) |
| Real Estate Agent | Title companies, mortgage brokers, home warranty companies |
| Procurement Officer | Vendor payment records, disclosed family relationships |
| Journalist | PR firms, political organizations, corporate sponsors |

## The Warranty Model: Skin in the Game

Claims without consequences are cheap. The **warranted attestation** adds teeth:

<div style="max-width: 600px; margin: 24px auto; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; border: 2px solid #8B0000; background: #fff; padding: 25px;">
  <div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 20px;">
    <div style="font-size: 1.3em; font-weight: bold; color: #8B0000;">WARRANTY TERMS</div>
    <div style="font-size: 0.9em; color: #666;">Incorporated by Reference into Attestation</div>
  </div>
<div style="font-size: 0.9em; line-height: 1.8;">
    <p><strong>Section 4.2 — Liquidated Damages</strong></p>
    <p>In the event that any attestation of non-compensation is found to be materially false, the attesting individual agrees to pay to the affected party:</p>
<div style="background: #fff5f5; padding: 15px; margin: 15px 0; border-left: 4px solid #8B0000;">
      <strong>Two times (2x) the undisclosed compensation received</strong><br>
      <span style="font-size: 0.85em;">Plus reasonable attorneys' fees and investigation costs.</span>
    </div>
<p style="font-size: 0.85em; color: #666;">This remedy is in addition to any regulatory penalties, license sanctions, or criminal liability that may apply. The attesting party waives any defense of "good faith" or "inadvertent omission."</p>
  </div>
</div>

### Why 2x Works

- **Deterrent Effect:** The downside of lying exceeds the upside of hiding
- **Self-Selection:** Only truly conflict-free professionals will enroll
- **Client Confidence:** The warranty signals "I'm betting my money on this being true"
- **Enforcement:** Private right of action—no need to wait for regulators

### Who Administers the Warranty?

Options include:
- **Professional liability insurers** (E&O policies with attestation riders)
- **Industry associations** (NAPFA for fee-only advisors, specialty medical societies)
- **Independent registries** (like a "conflict-free certification body")
- **Bonding companies** (similar to contractor bonds)

## Use Cases by Profession

### Fee-Only Financial Advisors

**The Claim:** "I'm fee-only. I don't receive commissions, revenue sharing, or referral fees."

**The Verification:**
- CRD/FINRA confirms no commission-based licenses active
- Fund companies confirm no revenue sharing agreements
- Insurance carriers confirm no policies placed for commission

**Why It Matters:** "Fee-only" is a marketing term often abused. True fee-only advisors want to prove it; fake ones can't.

### Physicians

**The Claim:** "I have no financial relationships with pharmaceutical or device companies."

**The Verification:**
- CMS Open Payments database cross-reference
- Hospital system confirms salary-only compensation
- No equity holdings in healthcare companies (via attestation)

**Why It Matters:** Patients choosing between branded and generic drugs deserve to know if their doctor is financially influenced.

### Insurance Brokers

**The Claim:** "I shop all carriers and recommend based solely on your needs."

**The Verification:**
- Carrier commission records (if accessible)
- Disclosure of any enhanced commission arrangements
- Confirmation of no volume bonuses or override agreements

**Why It Matters:** Brokers often receive 3x commission from preferred carriers—steering clients without disclosure.

### Real Estate Professionals

**The Claim:** "I receive no referral fees from the mortgage broker, title company, or inspector I recommend."

**The Verification:**
- Title company confirms no MSA (marketing services agreement) payments
- Mortgage broker confirms no referral fee
- Inspector confirms no kickback arrangement

**Why It Matters:** RESPA prohibits some of these payments, but enforcement is weak. Verification shifts proof to the professional.

### Procurement Officers

**The Claim:** "I have no personal financial interest in any vendor I've selected."

**The Verification:**
- Vendor payment records (none to officer or family)
- Equity disclosure (no holdings in selected vendors)
- Employment history (no recent employment with vendor)

**Why It Matters:** Public and corporate procurement fraud runs into the billions. Verified conflict disclosures add accountability.

### Journalists & Analysts

**The Claim:** "I receive no compensation from the companies I cover."

**The Verification:**
- Corporate payment disclosures (speaking fees, consulting)
- Political organization contributions
- PR firm payment records

**Why It Matters:** In an era of "sponsored content" and undisclosed conflicts, verified independence matters for credibility.

## Third-Party Use

**Clients & Patients**
Before major decisions (investment allocation, surgery, home purchase), verify that the advisor has no undisclosed conflicts.

**Regulators (SEC, DOL, State Insurance Commissioners)**
Spot-check attestations against known payment records. Verified disclosures make enforcement easier—lies become provable.

**Employers & Compliance Departments**
Wealth management firms, hospital systems, and procurement departments can require verified attestations from employees as a condition of certain roles.

**Journalists & Researchers**
When writing about industry influence (pharma payments to doctors, carrier influence on brokers), verified attestations provide a clean dataset.

**Litigation Support**
In fiduciary breach cases, verified disclosures (or their absence) become evidence. "He never disclosed the $50,000 he received from the fund he recommended."

---

## Verification Architecture

### The Fraud Vectors

- **Hidden Commissions:** Receiving payments through family members, shell companies, or deferred arrangements
- **Revenue Sharing:** Technical compliance with "no commissions" while receiving basis points from fund companies
- **Soft Dollars:** Non-cash benefits (research, conferences, gifts) that don't appear on payment records
- **Consulting Arrangements:** "Legitimate" consulting contracts that are really pay-for-access
- **Equity Interests:** Owning stock in companies you recommend or regulate

### The Fix: Multi-Source Verification

**Individual Attestation** → Signed statement of non-compensation
**Payer Confirmation** → Entities that would pay confirm $0 (or disclose amounts)
**Database Cross-Reference** → CMS Open Payments, FINRA, carrier records
**Public Records** → SEC filings, corporate disclosures, property records
**Warranty Backing** → Financial penalty for false statements

### Domain Binding

Attestations bind to the issuing registry's domain:
- `verify:conflictfree.org/attest/...` — Independent registry
- `verify:napfa.org/feeonly/...` — NAPFA fee-only confirmation
- `verify:openpaymentscheck.org/confirm/...` — CMS cross-reference

A fake attestation won't hash to the registry. And the registry only issues after verification.

---

## A New Industry?

This model creates infrastructure that doesn't quite exist today:

**Conflict-Free Certification Bodies**
Organizations that verify attestations against payer confirmations, maintain registries, and administer warranties.

**Payer APIs**
Standardized interfaces for "Did you pay this person?" queries—already emerging in Open Payments, could extend to other industries.

**Warranty Underwriters**
Insurance products backing attestations—similar to surety bonds, but for conflict disclosures.

**Verification Aggregators**
Services that pull from multiple sources (CMS, FINRA, carrier records) and issue unified attestations.

The demand exists: clients want conflict-free advice, professionals want to prove they're clean, and regulators want enforceable disclosures. OCR-to-hash provides the verification layer; the payer-as-fact-checker model provides the truth anchor; the warranty provides the teeth.
