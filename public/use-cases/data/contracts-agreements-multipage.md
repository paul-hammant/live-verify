## What are Multi-Page Contracts?

Contracts are legally binding agreements between parties. Multi-page contracts include commercial agreements, employment contracts, real estate transactions, loan documents, and partnership agreements. Each page must be verifiable to prevent page substitution attacks where favorable terms are swapped for unfavorable ones.

Contract fraud includes altering terms after signing, substituting pages, forging signatures, and misrepresenting agreed terms. Per-page verification creates an immutable record of exactly what was signed.

**Note:** Due to multi-page complexity, contract verification is typically **browser-extension only** rather than camera-based OCR.

## Per-Page Verification

Each page carries its own verification line. The signature page contains a rollup hash of all prior pages, binding the entire document together.

## Data Verified

Parties, effective date, key terms (compensation, term, obligations), signatures, page sequence integrity, exhibit references.

**Document Types:**
- **Commercial Contracts:** Service agreements, supply contracts.
- **Employment Agreements:** Offer letters, employment contracts.
- **Real Estate Contracts:** Purchase agreements, leases.
- **Loan Documents:** Credit agreements, promissory notes.
- **Partnership/Operating Agreements:** Entity governance documents.
- **Licensing Agreements:** IP licenses, software licenses.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`acme-corp.com`, law firm domain) and contract status.

**Status Indications:**
- **Executed** — All parties have signed.
- **Pending Signature** — Awaiting one or more signatures.
- **Amended** — Modified by subsequent amendment.
- **Terminated** — Contract ended per terms or mutual agreement.
- **Expired** — Contract term completed.
- **Disputed** — Terms or validity under dispute.

## Second-Party Use

The **Contracting Parties** benefit from verification.

**Dispute Prevention:** Both parties can verify they have identical copies of what was signed.

**Enforcement:** In litigation, verified contracts prove exact terms agreed.

**Audits:** Proving contract terms to auditors, regulators, or tax authorities.

## Third-Party Use

**Courts / Arbitrators**
**Dispute Resolution:** Verified contracts establish what terms were actually agreed.

**Auditors**
**Contract Review:** Verify material contracts for financial statement purposes.

**Regulators**
**Compliance:** Verify required contract terms are present (e.g., consumer protections).

**Insurers**
**Coverage Determination:** Verify contract terms when determining liability coverage.

**Banks / Lenders**
**Collateral Review:** Verify contract terms before accepting contracts as collateral.

**M&A Advisors**
**Due Diligence:** Verify key contract terms of acquisition targets.

## Verification Architecture

**The Contract Fraud Problem**

- **Page Substitution:** Swapping pages to change terms after signing.
- **Term Alteration:** Editing amounts, dates, or obligations.
- **Signature Forgery:** Adding unauthorized signatures.
- **Version Confusion:** Presenting draft versions as final.
- **Exhibit Fraud:** Substituting referenced exhibits.

**Issuer Types**

**Law Firms:** Drafting and maintaining executed contracts.
**Corporate Legal Departments:** In-house contract management.
**Contract Management Platforms:** (DocuSign, Ironclad, Agiloft).
**Notaries:** For contracts requiring notarization.
**Escrow Agents:** For contracts with escrow requirements.

**Per-Page Integrity**

Each page hash prevents substitution. The signature page's rollup hash creates a cryptographic chain binding all pages. If any page is modified, the rollup verification fails.

**Browser Extension Only**

Camera-based OCR is impractical for contracts due to:
- Document length (5-100+ pages for complex agreements)
- Complex formatting (numbered sections, exhibits, schedules)
- Legal precision requirements (every word matters)
- Multi-party signature verification

Browser extension allows verification of digital contracts page-by-page with automatic rollup validation. For physical contracts, scanning to PDF then browser verification is the recommended path.

**Amendment Handling**

Amendments reference the original contract and modify specific terms. Each amendment is verified separately, with the amendment hash chain linked to the original contract hash.

## Witness Services as Infrastructure

A new class of **"witness" SaaS companies** could emerge to provide verification endpoints for parties who lack their own web infrastructure:

**For Individuals:**
- Freelancers verifying client contracts
- Landlords/tenants verifying lease agreements
- Individuals in private sales (vehicles, equipment)
- Family agreements (loans between relatives, estate arrangements)

**For Small Businesses:**
- SMBs without IT resources to run verification endpoints
- Sole proprietors, partnerships, micro-businesses
- Contractors verifying work orders and change orders

**For Civic/Community Use:**
- Homeowner associations verifying meeting minutes
- Community groups, clubs, societies
- Local government bodies (town councils, school boards)
- Religious organizations verifying governance documents

**Business Model:**
- Subscription-based hash hosting and verification
- Per-document fees for occasional users
- White-label verification for law firms, accountants
- API access for integration with contract management systems

These witness services democratize verification - a sole proprietor can offer the same cryptographic trust as a Fortune 500 company. The `verify:` line points to the witness service's domain (e.g., `verify:witnessco.com/contracts/abc123`) rather than requiring each party to operate their own infrastructure.
