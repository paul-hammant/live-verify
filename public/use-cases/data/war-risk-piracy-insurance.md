## What is War Risk and Piracy Insurance?

In global shipping, standard hull insurance often excludes "War Risks" (e.g., missiles, sea mines) and "Piracy." Shipowners must buy specialized **War Risk Insurance** when a vessel enters a "High-Risk Area" (HRA), such as the Red Sea, the Gulf of Aden, or the Strait of Hormuz. A **War Risk Binder** or Certificate is the proof that the vessel has the extra multi-million dollar coverage needed for these zones.

These documents are the "Combat Passport" for a ship. Fraud is high-stakes: a shipowner might create a fake "Lloyd's" binder to trick a bank or a charterer into believing the ship is covered for a Red Sea transit, when it actually is not. Similarly, they might "edit" a policy to remove a mandatory "Armed Guard" requirement to save on security costs. Verified hashes bind the **Vessel IMO, Transit Dates, and Specific High-Risk Zones** to the specialist insurer's domain (e.g., `beazley.com` or `dnv.com`).

## Data Verified

IMO number, vessel name, insurer name, insured owner name, voyage dates, specific HRA zones (e.g., Red Sea, Indian Ocean), hull value limit, TPL (Third-Party Liability) limit, kidnap & ransom (K&R) sub-limit, armed guard warranty status (PMSC), date of issuance, broker ID.

**Document Types:**
- **War Risk Binder:** The primary 1-page voyage proof.
- **K&R (Kidnap & Ransom) Policy:** Specifically for piracy regions.
- **Notice of Area Breach:** (Linked hash) reporting a deviation into an un-insured zone.
- **PMSC Authorization:** Proof that the hired guards are approved by the insurer.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`beazley.com`, `hiscox.com`, `lloyds.com`) and the vessel standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Bound / Covered** — Policy is active for the stated voyage and zones.
- **Area Exclusion Alert** — **ALERT:** The vessel is entering a zone not covered by the hash.
- **Warranty Breach** — **CRITICAL:** Insurer has flagged a failure to maintain security (e.g., guards not on board).
- **Lapsed** — **ALERT:** The voyage window has passed; coverage terminated.

## Second-Party Use

The **Shipowner / Master** benefits from verification.

**Suez Canal / Port Entry:** Before a vessel is allowed to enter a high-risk canal or port, the authorities demand proof of war risk insurance. The Master shows the verified hash. "Verified by Beazley" ensures the port that the ship has the $500M+ coverage needed to handle a wreck removal after a missile strike, allowing the ship to pass without delay.

**Charterer Trust:** Before a global commodity firm (e.g., Trafigura or Vitol) hires a ship for a Red Sea route, they scan the P&I and War Risk hashes. Verification ensures the ship meets their "Tier-1 Vetting" standards for safety.

## Third-Party Use

**Trade Finance Banks**
**Collateral Protection:** Banks lending against the "Cargo Value" scan the vessel's war risk hash. If it returns **"EXCLUDED - RED SEA,"** the bank can instantly block the ship's route to protect their collateral from un-insured loss.

**Private Maritime Security Companies (PMSCs)**
**Engagement Vetting:** Before providing armed guards to a ship, the security firm verifies the vessel's insurance. Verification ensures they aren't working for a "Rogue Ship" that lacks the K&R coverage needed if the guards themselves are captured.

**Coastal Navies / Coast Guards**
**Incident Response:** After a ship is attacked, the responding Navy scans the verified hash to identify the insurer and P&I club for coordination of salvage and crew recovery.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Zone Masking" Fraud Problem**

- **Zone Inflation:** Editing a "Gulf of Aden Only" policy to include the "Red Sea" on a PDF to avoid a $50,000 premium hike.
- **Guard Ghosting:** Removing the "Armed Guard Required" clause from a policy before showing it to a charterer to save on security fees.
- **IMO Clamping:** Using a valid binder for a high-quality ship to cover for an un-insured, low-quality "Shadow Fleet" vessel.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**Global Specialty Insurers.**
**Lloyd's of London Marine Syndicates.**
**Maritime Security Registries.**

**Privacy Salt:** Highly Critical. Vessel positions and insurance values are national security and high-value trade secrets. The hash must be salted and access restricted to authorized maritime authorities.

## Rationale

War risk is the "Highest Stakes" in maritime law. By turning binders into verifiable digital bridges, we protect the global supply chain from the risk of un-insured catastrophes and ensure that "Safety in Conflict" is backed by cryptographic proof.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing

A jurisdiction may require the issuer to retain a **witnessing firm** for regulatory compliance. The witnessing firm:

- Receives all hashes from the issuer, and any subsequent changes to the payload as they happen—which may manifest as a new hash, a status change, or even a 404 (record deleted)
- Receives structured content/metadata (key identifiers and dates)
- Does **NOT** receive plaintext or sensitive personal information
- Provides an immutable, timestamped audit trail—available to the jurisdiction on demand, to document holders/third parties during disputes, or as expert witness testimony in legal proceedings

This provides:
- **Non-repudiation:** Issuer cannot deny issuing the document
- **Timestamp proof:** Document existed at a specific time
- **Regulatory audit:** Jurisdictions can inspect the witness ledger for fraud detection
- **Resilience:** Verification works even if issuer's systems go down

**Public Blockchain (Non-Party)**

Witnessing firms may periodically commit rollups to an inexpensive public blockchain, providing an ultimate immutability guarantee. The blockchain is a "non-party"—infrastructure, not a participant in the transaction. This creates multiple verification paths:

1. **Issuer domain** — Direct check against the issuer
2. **Witnessing firm** — Independent confirmation with timestamp
3. **Public blockchain** — Decentralized trust anchor via rollup inclusion
