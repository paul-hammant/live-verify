## What are Shipping Instructions?

Before a ship leaves, the exporter must send **Shipping Instructions (SI)** to the carrier (like Maersk or Hapag-Lloyd). This document tells the carrier exactly what to write on the final Bill of Lading.

It's the "Draft" of the most important paper in trade. It includes:
1.  **The Cargo:** "1,200 iPhones" vs "1,200 Books."
2.  **The Parties:** Who is sending and who is receiving.
3.  **The Route:** Which ports the ship will stop at.

Fraudsters often "mis-declare" cargo in the instructions (e.g., calling high-tax electronics "low-tax toys") to get a lower freight rate or bypass customs checks.

## Data Verified

Shipper name, Booking number, Vessel name, Voyage number, Cargo description, HS Codes, Weight, Destination port.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`maersk.com`) and current booking status.

**Status Indications:**
- **Draft Received** — Carrier has the instructions.
- **B/L Pending** — Instructions verified; final Bill of Lading being printed.
- **Mismatch Alert** — **ALERT:** Description on SI does not match the physical scan at the port.

## Second-Party Use

The **Exporter (Shipper)** benefits from verification.
- **Error Prevention:** Ensuring the carrier's final Bill of Lading exactly matches the verified instructions, preventing costly "Letter of Credit" rejections at the bank.
- **Draft Approval:** Instantly approving the digital draft from the carrier by verifying the hash against their own internal shipping system.

## Third-Party Use

**Customs Authorities**
**Pre-manifest Screening:** Customs can verify the Shipping Instructions *before* the ship sails. If the description on the SI doesn't match the carrier's verified data, the container can be flagged for inspection at the loading port.

**Logistics Aggregators (Flexport / Freightos)**
**Data Integrity:** Automatically ingesting verified shipping data from dozens of different carriers into a single dashboard without manual data entry errors.

## Competition vs. EDI / Blockchain

| Feature | OCR-to-Hash | EDI (Shipping Standard) | GSBN Blockchain |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Trust** | **Cryptographic.** | **System-Bound.** | **Consensus-Bound.** |
| **Accessibility** | **Universal.** Any clerk can scan. | **Zero.** Requires heavy IT setup. | **Low.** Requires membership. |
| **Adoption** | **High.** Works with PDFs. | **Universal.** (For big ships). | **Low.** (Emerging). |

**Why OCR wins here:**
The "Silo" Problem. While big carriers use EDI, they don't share those logs with the exporter's local bank or a foreign customs agent. OCR-to-hash turns the **Draft PDF** into a portable "Token of Intent" that anyone can trust.
