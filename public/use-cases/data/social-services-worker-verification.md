## What is Social Services Verification?

In child welfare and adult protective services, the "Home Visit" is a critical and sensitive moment. A worker from **Child Protective Services (CPS)** or a **Welfare Officer** may knock on a door at any time to inspect a child's environment or check on a vulnerable senior.

This high-stakes authority is a primary weapon for criminals. Scammers pose as "Social Workers" to gain entry for home invasion, robbery, or in extreme cases, **Child Abduction.** Families are often too scared or intimidated to challenge the person's authority.

OCR-to-hash allows a family to scan the worker's ID card to verify: **"Is this a legitimate government employee, and are they currently authorized to conduct field investigations?"**

## Data Verified

Worker name, employee ID number, agency name, photograph (via hash), role/title, supervisor name, office location, expiration date, background check status.

**Document Types:**
- **Agency ID Badge:** The primary field identification.
- **Notice of Welfare Check:** Paper left if the resident isn't home.
- **Warrant of Entry:** (In some jurisdictions) Formal court-linked authority.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`dcfs.illinois.gov`, `dcyf.wa.gov`) and the worker's status.

**Status Indications:**
- **Active Duty** — Worker is currently employed and authorized for field work.
- **Verified Investigation** — (Optional) A case number exists for this household today.
- **Inactive** — Person is no longer an agency employee.
- **Fraud Alert** — **ALERT:** This ID has been flagged for impersonation attempts.

## Second-Party Use

The **Family / Citizen** benefits from verification.

**Anti-Abduction Safety:** A person claiming to be "from the state" arrives to take a child into protective custody. The terrified parent scans the worker's ID. If it returns **"ACTIVE DUTY - DCFS,"** they know they must comply with the legal process. If it returns **"UNKNOWN,"** they immediately lock the door and call 911 to prevent a kidnapping.

**Home Security:** A senior citizen living alone is visited by an "Adult Protective Services" worker. They verify the credentials through the screen door, ensuring the visitor is a vetted professional and not a "Sweetheart Swindler" or burglar.

## Third-Party Use

**Police and First Responders**
**Scene Coordination:** Patrol officers called to a "Domestic Incident" can quickly verify the identity of social workers already on the scene, ensuring that the "Civilian" presence is authorized and not an interloper.

**Hospital Security**
**Patient Access:** Verifying the credentials of caseworkers visiting children or seniors in the ER or ICU to ensure they have the legal right to access medical info.

## Verification Architecture

**The "State Authority" Fraud Problem**

- **Intimidation Scams:** Criminals using fake "DCFS" badges to threaten parents into paying "fines" or giving up children.
- **Information Gathering:** Posing as a social worker to "interview" neighbors and gather PII for identity theft.
- **Revocation Hiding:** A worker who was fired for abuse keeping their ID to continue harassing former clients.

**Issuer Types**

**State Departments of Human Services.**
**County Child Welfare Agencies.**
**Contracted Foster Care Agencies.**

**Privacy Salt:** Critical. Caseworker names and routes are highly sensitive. The hash must be salted to prevent "Caseload Scraping" or tracking the movements of individual employees.

## Rationale

Social services verification is about "Safety for the Vulnerable." By allowing families to instantly cross-reference a physical badge with a digital government record, we eliminate the primary weapon of predators: the fear of state authority.
