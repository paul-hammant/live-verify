    "rationale": "Prospective employers and background-check providers waste time confirming references via phone/email and are exposed to forged letters. Domain binding verifies the employer’s domain and makes references machine-checkable at point of use. Revocation allows a reference to be withdrawn or corrected (e.g., issued in error). These letters can be short-form and OCR-friendly compared to full HR files.\n\nA reference can also be embedded inside a CV/resume (or appended as separate pages): a “collapsed” interactive CV can expand a specific verified reference on tap, while print defaults to all references expanded."
