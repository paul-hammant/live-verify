## What is Disability Insurance?

Your most valuable asset isn't your house; it's your **ability to earn an income**. If a surgeon breaks their hand, they lose millions in future earnings. **Disability Insurance** protects that future cash flow.

High-earners keep these **Policy Schedules** for 30+ years. They use them to prove their financial stability to lenders and business partners.

Fraud is high-stakes here: scammers often edit a cheap "Any Occupation" policy to look like a premium "Own Occupation" policy to look more credit-worthy. Verified hashes turn the policy folder into a live, trusted financial link that lasts a lifetime.

## Data Verified

Insured name, specific occupation class, monthly benefit amount, elimination period (waiting time), benefit period (duration), COLA (Cost of Living Adjustment) riders, effective date, issuing carrier.

**Document Types:**
- **Policy Schedule (Declarations):** The 1-page executive summary.
- **Verification of Insurance (VOI):** 1-page proof for lenders or employers.
- **Rider Activation Notice:** Proving an increase in coverage was purchased.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`unum.com`, `northwesternmutual.com`, `guardianlife.com`) and policy status.

**Status Indications:**
- **Active** — Premium paid; coverage in force.
- **Lapsed** — Coverage terminated due to non-payment.
- **Reduced** — Benefit amount lowered (e.g., due to salary change).
- **In-Claim** — Policyholder is currently receiving benefits.

## Second-Party Use

The **Policyholder (Professional)** benefits from verification.

**Financial Planning:** Proving to a financial advisor or spouse that their "Neurosurgeon Income" is protected by a verified $15,000/month policy. This removes the "Trust Gap" when building a long-term retirement plan.

**Mortgage Lending:** Proving to a bank that their high income is insured even if they become disabled. This can help high-earners qualify for larger loans by de-risking the lender's future cash flow assumptions.

## Third-Party Use

**Mortgage Underwriters**
**Risk De-risking:** Lenders often ignore disability insurance because it's too hard to verify the "Fine Print" (e.g., Own-Occ vs. Any-Occ). OCR-to-hash turns the policy schedule into a verified digital artifact that proves the quality of the insurance.

**Divorce / Legal Settlements**
**Asset Integrity:** Verifying the existence and value of disability policies during asset division to ensure future income potential is accurately accounted for.

**Business Partners**
**Buy-Sell Agreements:** Ensuring that a partner's "Disability Buy-Out" policy is verified active and sufficient to fund the purchase of their shares if they become incapacitated.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Phantom Policy" Fraud Problem**

- **Benefit Inflation:** Editing a $2,000 policy to read $20,000 to trick a bank or an ex-spouse into believing the person has higher insured wealth.
- **Definition Tampering:** Changing "Any Occupation" (cheap) to "Own Occupation" (expensive) on the paper policy to look more credit-worthy.
- **Status Faking:** Showing an old "Active" policy paper for a policy that lapsed 3 years ago.

**Issuer Types**

**Individual Carriers:** (Unum, Guardian, MassMutual, Ameritas).
**Specialist Brokers:** (Providing VOI certificates).

## Competition vs. Broker Confirmation

| Feature | OCR-to-Hash | Manual Broker Call | Scanned PDF |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Bound to the Carrier. | **Human.** Prone to errors or social engineering. | **Zero.** Easily forged. |
| **Speed** | **Instant.** 5-second scan. | **Slow.** Takes 2-3 business days. | **Instant.** |
| **Availability** | **24/7.** Works when offices are closed. | **Restricted.** | **Universal.** |
| **Integrity** | **Cryptographic.** Binds the "Occupation Class." | **Vague.** "Yes, they have a policy." | **Vulnerable.** |

**Why OCR wins here:** The "Wealth Preservation" Reality. Disability insurance is a foundational asset for doctors and lawyers. They often hold these policies for 30+ years. OCR-to-hash turns the **Physical Policy Folder** into a permanent, verifiable financial link that survives multiple broker changes and office closures.
