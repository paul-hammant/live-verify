## Verification Architecture

**The Credit card travel benefits and coverage confirmations Fraud Problem**

Document fraud creates significant risks:

- **Fabrication:** Entirely fake documents created from scratch
- **Alteration:** Genuine documents with modified content (dates, amounts, names)
- **Impersonation:** Documents falsely claiming to be from legitimate issuers
- **Expired/Revoked Documents:** Presenting invalid documents as current
- **Coverage Inflation:** Inflating coverage limits or adding non-existent coverage
- **Backdating:** Creating policies with false effective dates
- **Ghost Policies:** Fabricated policies from non-existent insurers

OCR-to-hash verification addresses fake and altered documents. Domain binding confirms the claimed issuer actually issued the document.

**Issuer Types**

Who issues these documents and operates verification endpoints?

**Primary Issuers:** Organizations with direct authority to issue these documents.

**Licensed Professionals:** Professionals authorized to create and certify documents.

**Government Agencies:** Federal, state, or local agencies with jurisdiction.

**Industry Bodies:** Trade associations and professional organizations.

**System Integration**

Insurance verification integrates with industry systems:

**Policy Administration Systems:** Core insurance systems generate verification hashes at policy issuance.

**ACORD Standards:** Insurance industry data standards could include verification fields.

**State Insurance Databases:** Regulators maintain databases for systematic hash receipt.

**Agent Portals:** Insurance agents access verification for client service.

## Rationale

Domain binding verifies card issuer. Credit card travel insurance coverage verification. Trip delay/baggage delay benefit claims. Rental car collision damage waiver documentation.
