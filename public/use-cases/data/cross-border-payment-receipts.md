## What is a Remittance Receipt?

When you send money to another country (e.g., via Wise or Western Union), you get a **Transfer Confirmation**.

This receipt is the only proof that the money is en route. Recipient freelancers or family members need to know the money is real and the "Exchange Rate" is fair.

Fraudsters often use "Fake Screenshots" to trick sellers into shipping goods before the money actually arrives (or when it was never sent). OCR-to-hash turns the static PDF confirmation into a live, verifiable proof-of-payment that the recipient can trust instantly.

## Data Verified

Sender name, Recipient name/Bank details, Transfer ID, amount sent (currency A), amount received (currency B), exchange rate, transaction fees, timestamp of completion, issuing money transmitter.

**Document Types:**
- **Transfer Confirmation:** The standard PDF/Email for the sender.
- **Remittance Receipt:** For cash-pickup services (e.g., Western Union).
- **SWIFT MT103 Message:** Technical confirmation for high-value B2B wires.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`wise.com`, `remitly.com`) and current fund status.

**Status Indications:**
- **Completed** — Funds have been delivered to the recipient's bank.
- **Cancelled** — Transaction voided; funds returned to sender.
- **Processing** — Funds en route; rate is locked.
- **Hold** — Under review (e.g., for compliance/AML reasons).

## Second-Party Use

The **Sender** (Remitter) benefits from verification.

**Payment Proof:** Proving to a freelance developer or a family member abroad that the $5,000 was *actually sent* and isn't just a "Fake Screenshot." Verification prevents the "Recipient says they didn't get it" dispute.

**Expense Audit:** Providing verified proof of foreign business expenses to a company's finance department, ensuring the "Exchange Rate" and "Fees" claimed match the verified reality.

## Third-Party Use

**Tax Authorities / Customs**
**Source of Funds:** Verifying large incoming international payments to comply with anti-money laundering (AML) laws. A verified receipt from `wise.com` is more authoritative than a plain paper printout.

**Mortgage Lenders**
**Downpayment Vetting:** When a homebuyer receives a "Gift" from a relative overseas, the lender must verify the source. OCR-to-hash allows the lender to trust the international transfer receipt instantly.

**Regulators (CFPB / FCA)**
**Transparency Compliance:** Ensuring that money transmitters are correctly disclosing their "Total Cost" (Rate + Fees) as required by consumer protection laws (e.g., Dodd-Frank Section 1073).

## Verification Architecture

**The "Fake Screenshot" Fraud Problem**

- **Screenshot Editing:** Using a browser "Inspect Element" tool to change a $100 transfer to $10,000, then taking a screenshot to trick a seller into shipping goods.
- **Rate Manipulation:** Hiding a high "FX Markup" by editing the exchange rate on the PDF to look better than it was.
- **Ghost Transfers:** Creating a fake PDF confirmation for a transfer that was never initiated to "buy time" from a creditor.

**Issuer Types**

**Fintech Remitters:** (Wise, Remitly, WorldRemit, Revolut).
**Legacy Banks:** (SWIFT gpi tracking).
**Cash Networks:** (Western Union, MoneyGram).

**Privacy Salt:** Highly critical. Remittance data involves PII and banking info. The hash must be salted to prevent "Guessing" transfer IDs to see who is moving money.

## Competition vs. SWIFT gpi (Tracking)

| Feature | OCR-to-Hash | SWIFT gpi (Bank Tracking) | Scanned PDF / Image |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Bound to the Payer. | **Bank-Bound.** Trust the technical message. | **Zero.** Easily forged. |
| **User Access** | **Universal.** Any recipient can verify. | **Restricted.** Usually only the sending/receiving banks see the log. | **Instant.** |
| **Integrity** | **Binds FX Rates.** Protects the numbers. | **Data-Only.** | **Vulnerable.** |
| **Interoperability** | **High.** Works for non-SWIFT fintechs. | **Limited.** Only for SWIFT-member banks. | **Universal.** |

**Why OCR wins here:** The "End-to-End" Reality. SWIFT gpi is great for banks, but the actual **human recipient** often just gets a PDF in their email. OCR-to-hash turns that **Static PDF** into a live, verifiable proof-of-payment that bridges the gap between the bank's technical ledger and the human's inbox.
