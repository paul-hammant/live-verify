## What is a Quality Control (QC) Report?

In manufacturing, the **Quality Control (QC) Report** (or Certificate of Conformance) is the proof that a specific batch of products was tested and met the required safety and engineering tolerances.

For critical components (e.g., bolts for an airplane wing, medical implants, or structural steel), a fake QC report can lead to catastrophic failure and loss of life. Shady suppliers often "edit" a failed test result into a "PASS," or use a real report from a high-quality batch to cover for a cheaper, low-quality one. Verified hashes bind the **Batch Number, Test Results, and Inspector's Name** to the manufacturer's or the lab's domain (e.g., `boeing.com` or `sgs.com`).

## Data Verified

Batch/Lot number, product description, inspection date, inspector name/ID, test parameters (tensile, tolerance, chemical composition), pass/fail status, quantity inspected, customer name, facility ID.

**Document Types:**
- **Certificate of Conformance (CoC):** Basic proof of meeting specs.
- **Mill Test Report (MTR):** Detailed chemical and physical analysis.
- **Dimensional Inspection Report:** Specific measurement data.
- **Destructive Testing Report:** Results from breaking sample units.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`precision-alloys.com`, `sgs.com`, `intertek.com`) and the report standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Verified / PASS** — Report matches the lab's original testing snapshot.
- **Recalled** — **CRITICAL:** The batch has been recalled due to post-inspection discovery of defects.
- **Quarantined** — **ALERT:** Batch is under investigation; do not use in production.
- **Superseded** — A newer, corrected report exists.

## Second-Party Use

The **Manufacturer (The Shop)** benefits from verification.

**Liability Shield:** If a customer claims a part failed, the shop can prove they performed the mandatory tests and had them verified at the time of shipping, defending against "Negligence" claims.

**Supply Chain Speed:** Attaching a verified hash to the shipping docs allows the buyer to skip their own "Incoming Inspection," reducing the time from the delivery dock to the assembly line by several days.

## Third-Party Use

**End-Users (e.g., Aircraft Maintenance)**
**Safety Audit:** A mechanic installing a part can scan the QC report. If the hash returns **"RECALLED - EMBRITTLEMENT RISK,"** they can stop the installation immediately, potentially preventing a crash.

**Government Safety Agencies (FAA, FDA)**
**Regulatory Oversight:** During a routine audit, the agency can scan random QC reports from the company's files. OCR-to-hash ensures the company isn't "Fabricating" tests to hide production errors.

**Insurance Loss Adjusters**
**Root Cause Analysis:** After an industrial accident, the insurer verifies the QC reports of all critical components to determine if the failure was due to a faulty part or improper maintenance.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Test-Result Tweak" Fraud Problem**

- **Tolerance Inflation:** Changing a "FAIL" result (e.g., 149,000 PSI) to a "PASS" (150,000 PSI) in a PDF editor.
- **Batch Swapping:** Using one "PASS" report for multiple different batches, some of which were never tested.
- **Credential Forgery:** Using a senior inspector's name on a report created by an untrained junior employee.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**Internal Factory Labs.**
**Independent Third-Party Labs (SGS, Intertek).**
**Standards Bodies.**

**Privacy Salt:** Critical. Test parameters and batch volumes are sensitive "Production Secrets." The hash must be salted to prevent competitors from mapping a factory's yield or capacity.

## Rationale

Quality Control is about "The Last Line of Defense." By turning static test reports into live digital bridges, we create a transparent chain of safety that spans the entire global supply chain.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing

A jurisdiction may require the issuer to retain a **witnessing firm** for regulatory compliance. The witnessing firm:

- Receives all hashes from the issuer, and any subsequent changes to the payload as they happen—which may manifest as a new hash, a status change, or even a 404 (record deleted)
- Receives structured content/metadata (key identifiers and dates)
- Does **NOT** receive plaintext or sensitive personal information
- Provides an immutable, timestamped audit trail—available to the jurisdiction on demand, to document holders/third parties during disputes, or as expert witness testimony in legal proceedings

This provides:
- **Non-repudiation:** Issuer cannot deny issuing the document
- **Timestamp proof:** Document existed at a specific time
- **Regulatory audit:** Jurisdictions can inspect the witness ledger for fraud detection
- **Resilience:** Verification works even if issuer's systems go down

**Public Blockchain (Non-Party)**

Witnessing firms may periodically commit rollups to an inexpensive public blockchain, providing an ultimate immutability guarantee. The blockchain is a "non-party"—infrastructure, not a participant in the transaction. This creates multiple verification paths:

1. **Issuer domain** — Direct check against the issuer
2. **Witnessing firm** — Independent confirmation with timestamp
3. **Public blockchain** — Decentralized trust anchor via rollup inclusion
