## What is a Safety Data Sheet (SDS)?

An **SDS** is the "User Manual" for a chemical. It tells workers and firefighters exactly how dangerous a product is (e.g., "Will this explode?") and how to treat a person who was exposed to it.

By federal law (**OSHA**), every business must have a "Yellow Binder" containing the latest SDS for every chemical on the site.

Fraud is dangerous here: some managers use a 10-year-old SDS to hide that a chemical was recently discovered to be a carcinogen (cancer-causing). Verified hashes allow a worker to scan the binder and see the **verified current version** from the manufacturer's domain instantly.

## Data Verified

Product name, CAS number, manufacturer name, GHS hazard classifications (1-4), signal word (Danger/Warning), pictograms, emergency contact info, revision date, specific hazardous ingredient percentages (Section 3).

**Document Types:**
- **Safety Data Sheet (SDS):** The full 16-section technical document.
- **SDS Summary Sheet:** A 1-page "Quick-Reference" for the shop floor.
- **Hazardous Material Declaration:** For shipping and transport.
- **Exposure Control Plan:** (Linked hash) for facility-specific safety.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (the Chemical Manufacturer) and current SDS version status.

**Status Indications:**
- **Current** — Document matches the manufacturer's latest safety guidance.
- **Outdated** — **ALERT:** A newer SDS exists with updated safety or exposure data.
- **Recalled** — Product withdrawn from market; use prohibited.
- **Invalid** — Serial number or chemical breakdown mismatch.

## Second-Party Use

The **Employer (Facility Manager)** benefits from verification.

**OSHA Audit Readiness:** Proving to an inspector during a site visit that the "Yellow Binders" in the warehouse contain the **Verified Latest Version** of every SDS. Failure to provide current SDSs is one of the most common OSHA citations ($15,000+ per violation).

**Employee Training:** Ensuring that workers are reading verified, non-altered safety data, reducing the risk of "Home-Made" workarounds that lead to accidents.

## Third-Party Use

**First Responders (Fire / Hazmat)**
**Accident Response:** If a warehouse catches fire, responders scan the hash on the bin or the binder. "Verified by Global Chemicals" provides instant, trusted confirmation of the flash-point and toxicity, ensuring they don't use the wrong fire-suppression chemical.

**Environmental Auditors**
**Waste Compliance:** Verifying the chemical ingredients before authorizing disposal at a hazardous waste facility.

**Insurance Underwriters**
**Liability Rating:** Verifying that a chemical facility is following verified "Product Stewardship" and "Right-to-Know" standards.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Memory Hole" Fraud Problem**

- **Outdated Data:** A company keeping a 2010 SDS version because the 2026 version lists a "Cancer Warning" that would increase their insurance premiums.
- **Ingredient Hiding:** Editing a PDF to remove a highly toxic or regulated chemical from Section 3 to bypass environmental restrictions.
- **Fabricated Summaries:** Small shops creating their own "Safety Sheets" that don't match the manufacturer's official, legally-vetted warnings.

**Issuer Types**

**Chemical Manufacturers:** (e.g., Dow, BASF, 3M).
**Distributors:** (e.g., Grainger, Brenntag).
**SDS Aggregators:** (e.g., MSDSonline, VelocityEHS - hosting verified hashes).

## Competition vs. QR Codes / Digital Binders

| Feature | OCR-to-Hash | Standard QR Code | Digital SDS Portal |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Bound to the Manufacturer. | **Data-Only.** Often just a raw URL link. | **System-Bound.** |
| **Integrity** | **Cryptographic.** Protects the *Text*. | **Vulnerable.** QR can link to a fake page. | **High.** |
| **Offline Proof** | **Strong.** The paper/binder is the anchor. | **None.** Requires live internet to mean anything. | **Zero.** |
| **Field Use** | **Universal.** Works for printed "Cheat Sheets." | **Fragile.** Codes get torn/dirty. | **N/A.** |

**Why OCR wins here:** The "Binder Reality." OSHA requires that SDSs be "Readily Accessible" to workers. In high-risk areas (factories, ships, mines), this means a physical paper binder because tech fails. OCR-to-hash turns that **Mandatory Paper Binder** into a live digital checkpoint, ensuring that "Life Safety" data is as accurate as the cloud but as reliable as paper.
