## Data Verified

Insured name, premises address, stock-on-hand limit (USD), transit/shipping limits, specific vault/safe classification (UL Class), alarm monitoring status, trade show exhibition limits, memo/consignment limits, effective dates, issuing carrier.

**Document Types:**
- **Jewelers Block Certificate:** The primary proof of inventory protection.
- **Shipping Manifest Insurance:** For high-value FedEx/UPS/Brinks moves.
- **Consignment Memo:** (Linked hash) proving insurance for borrowed items.
- **Security Audit Report:** (Linked hash) proving the vault meets the policy terms.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`berkleyassetpro.com`, `chubb.com`, `lloyds.com`) and current policy standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **In Force** — Premium paid; $15M inventory is covered.
- **Cancelled** — **ALERT:** Coverage terminated (High-risk for suppliers).
- **Excursion Alert** — Vault or Alarm status found non-compliant in recent audit.
- **Lapsed** — Renewal pending or overdue.

## Second-Party Use

The **Jeweler (Store Owner)** benefits from verification.

**Consignment Vetting:** Proving to a high-end diamond supplier (e.g., De Beers or a private dealer) that their $2M stone is "Verified Covered" while sitting in the store's vault. No supplier will hand over diamonds on "Memo" without 100% cryptographic certainty that the insurance is real and active.

**Trade Show Access:** Proving coverage to specialized logistics firms or show organizers (e.g., JCK Las Vegas) before moving millions in stock into a temporary booth.

## Third-Party Use

**Diamond & Gem Suppliers**
**Inventory Risk:** Before shipping a high-value parcel, the supplier scans the jeweler's COI. "Verified by Berkley" ensures the jeweler hasn't "Edited" the $500k limit to look like $5M to hide their actual exposure.

**Banks / Lenders**
**Collateral Vetting:** Verifying the "Stock-on-Hand" insurance before using the jeweler's inventory as collateral for an operating loan.

**High-Value Couriers (Brinks / Malca-Amit)**
**Handoff Integrity:** Verifying that the jeweler's "Transit Limits" are verified and in force before accepting a parcel for pickup.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Vapor-Block" Fraud Problem**

- **Limit Inflation:** Editing a $1M "Small Shop" policy to read $10M to trick suppliers into sending more diamonds on consignment than the jeweler can safely insure.
- **Cancellation Hiding:** Keeping a valid-looking "Active" paper certificate after the insurer cancelled the policy due to a security failure (e.g., broken alarm).
- **Vault Fraud:** Claiming a "UL Class 3" vault status on the paper certificate when the actual verified policy only covers a residential-grade safe.

**Issuer Types**

**Specialty Luxury Carriers:** (Berkley Asset Protection, Chubb, Jewelers Mutual).
**Lloyd's Syndicates.**
**Security Auditing Firms:** (Hosting the verified vault hashes).

## Competition vs. Manual Broker Letters

| Feature | OCR-to-Hash | Manual Broker Letter | Scanned PDF |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Integrity** | **Cryptographic.** Binds the *Vault Class*. | **Subjective.** Relies on the broker's memory. | **Zero.** Easily forged. |
| **Speed** | **Instant.** 5-second scan at the vault. | **Slow.** Takes 2-3 business days to get a "Confirmation." | **Instant.** |
| **Availability** | **24/7.** Works during after-hours trades. | **Restricted.** Business hours only. | **Universal.** |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Bound to the Carrier. | **Human.** Prone to social engineering. | **Vulnerable.** |

**Why OCR wins here:** The "Memo Moment." High-stakes gem trades often happen at 10 PM in hotel rooms or private clubs. Suppliers need to trust the insurance *right now* before handing over the stones. OCR-to-hash turns the **Standard Insurance Folder** into a live digital checkpoint that provides "Bank-Vault" level trust anywhere in the world.
