## What is Global Entry Status?

**Global Entry** is a "Trusted Traveler" program that allows pre-vetted, low-risk travelers to skip the long lines at US Customs when returning from abroad. It also includes **TSA PreCheck** for domestic flights.

To get it, you must pass a rigorous federal background check and a face-to-face interview with a Customs officer. The **Membership Confirmation** is your proof of status.

Fraud is common: scammers often create fake "Global Entry" PDFs to trick employers into thinking they have a clean criminal record. Verified hashes allow an employer or airline to scan the letter and see the "APPROVED" status on the `cbp.dhs.gov` domain in seconds.

## Data Verified

Member name, PASSID (Membership #), program type (Global Entry, NEXUS, SENTRI, TSA PreCheck), status (Approved/Conditional/Revoked), Known Traveler Number (KTN), effective date, expiration date, issuing agency (CBP).

**Document Types:**
- **Membership Approval Letter:** The standard PDF for new members.
- **Conditional Approval Notice:** For scheduling interviews.
- **Revocation Notice:** (Linked hash) proving membership has been terminated.
- **KTN Confirmation:** For employer or airline travel profiles.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`cbp.dhs.gov`) and current membership standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Approved** — Member is verified and eligible for expedited processing.
- **Conditional** — Background check passed; interview pending.
- **Revoked** — **ALERT:** Membership terminated due to recent violation or arrest.
- **Expired** — Renewal required.

## Second-Party Use

The **Trusted Traveler** benefits from verification.

**Travel Booking:** Proving to an employer or travel agent that their "Known Traveler Number" is verified and active. This ensures the "TSA PreCheck" logo actually appears on their boarding pass, avoiding "Unverified" delays at security.

**Employment Vetting:** Proving to a new employer (especially in aviation or high-security logistics) that they have passed the federal "Trusted Traveler" vetting process, which acts as a pre-verified background check.

## Third-Party Use

**Airline Counter Agents**
**KTN Validation:** Instantly verifying a passenger's KTN status if it's missing from the boarding pass. OCR-to-hash connects the agent directly to the CBP record, bypassing the need for the traveler to log into their private TTP portal.

**TSA Officers (Security Checkpoint)**
**Access Control:** Verifying that a "Priority Access" or "TSA Pre" claim on a printed itinerary matches the verified TTP status of the passenger.

**International Employers**
**Reputation Review:** Using the Global Entry status as a verified proxy for a clean federal criminal and customs record.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Fake Trusted Traveler" Fraud Problem**

- **Status Fabrication:** Scammers creating fake "Global Entry Approved" PDFs to trick employers into skipping a background check.
- **Revocation Hiding:** A traveler who was caught smuggling (leading to revocation) keeping their physical card or old PDF to use PreCheck lanes.
- **PASSID Tampering:** Editing the "Expiration Date" on an old 2024 letter to make it look like a 2026 approval.

**Issuer Types**

**U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP):** The sole U.S. issuer.
**Canadian Border Services Agency (CBSA):** (For NEXUS co-branded letters).
**DHS TTP Portal:** (The digital record source).

**Privacy Salt:** Critical. PASSIDs and names are highly sensitive. The hash must be salted to prevent "Guess-and-Check" searches of the traveler database.

## Competition vs. TTP Online Portal

| Feature | OCR-to-Hash | TTP Official Portal | Physical TTP Card |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Integrity** | **Binds Passport to Status.** | **High.** Direct DB access. | **Mechanical.** Prone to forgery. |
| **Speed** | **Instant.** 5-second scan. | **Slow.** Requires 2FA, login, and navigation. | **Instant.** |
| **Field Access** | **High.** Works for airlines/employers. | **Zero.** Third parties never get TTP logins. | **Visual.** Trusted only via logo. |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Bound to `cbp.dhs.gov`. | **High.** | **Medium.** |

**Why OCR wins here:** The "Counter Reality." Travelers encounter airlines, employers, and foreign authorities in the physical world. They don't want to log into a federal portal with 2FA while standing at a check-in desk. OCR-to-hash turns the **Physical Confirmation Letter** into a high-speed digital dashboard that provides definitive proof of status in seconds.
