## What is a Passport?

A **Passport** is your "Global Identity Card." It is the most powerful travel document in the world, proving both your identity and your citizenship. A **Visa** is the official permission granted by a *foreign* country allowing you to enter their borders for a specific purpose (work, study, or tourism).

Beyond the airport, passports are used as the "Primary ID" for:
1.  **Opening Bank Accounts:** Satisfying strict AML/KYC laws.
2.  **Renting High-Value Assets:** Cars, apartments, or luxury equipment.
3.  **Cross-Border Business:** Signing contracts as a foreign entity.

**"High-Grade Clones"** are a major security threat. Sophisticated forgers can replicate holograms, security paper, and even RFID chips. However, they **cannot forge what the issuing government's server sends back**. OCR-to-hash turns the **Physical Data Page** into a live link to the government's secure database, allowing anyone from a bouncer to a bank teller to see if the passport was **Revoked or Reported Stolen** today.

## Data Verified

Full name, Nationality, Date of Birth, Passport Number, Document Serial Number, Issuing Authority ID, Place of Birth, Expiration Date, MRZ (Machine Readable Zone) checksums, Photo (via secure hash).

**Document Types:**
- **Standard Passport:** The foundational data page.
- **Entry/Exit Visa:** Full-page stickers for foreign entry.
- **Residency Permit (BRP):** Long-term stay authorization.
- **Emergency Travel Document:** Temporary 1-way paper for lost passports.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`gov.uk`, `state.gov`, `singpass.gov.sg`) and the live security status.

**Status Indications:**
- **Valid** — Passport is authentic and in good standing.
- **Reported Stolen/Lost** — **ALERT:** Bearer has reported this physical book missing.
- **Revoked** — **ALERT:** Citizenship or travel rights have been terminated.
- **Replaced** — A newer passport version exists for this person (common in clone detection).

## Second-Party Use

The **Passport Holder (Traveler)** benefits from verification.

**Digital Onboarding:** Proving their identity to an online bank or crypto exchange in seconds. A verified hash allows the bank to trust the "Data Page" without requiring the user to record a 3D "Video Selfie" (which many find invasive and buggy).

**Remote Work / Visas:** Providing a verified digital copy of their passport to a foreign employer, ensuring the HR team that the document is authentic without mailing the physical book across borders.

## Third-Party Use

**Airlines and Carriers**
**Check-in Integrity:** Before boarding a flight, the gate agent scans the data page. Verification ensures the passport hasn't been "reported stolen" in the last hour, reducing the carrier's liability for "Inadmissible Passenger" fines.

**Hospitality / Bouncers**
**Age & Identity:** Instantly confirming that a "Novice Fake" ID isn't authentic. Standard fakes look perfect to the eye; OCR-to-hash connects the bouncer directly to the government source in seconds.

**Border Control (Land/Sea)**
**Visual Augmentation:** Complementing chip-reading technology. If a passport's NFC chip is damaged or non-existent (as in many older or non-biometric passports), OCR-to-hash provides a "Chip-Level" trust anchor for the visual zone.

## Verification Architecture

**The "High-Grade Clone" Fraud Problem**

- **Identity Theft:** Using a real person's data on a cloned book with a different photo.
- **Status Hiding:** Presenting a physically "Valid" passport that has been revoked by the government for legal or security reasons.
- **The Doppelganger Attack:** Using a valid passport belonging to a similar-looking person. OCR-to-hash with **Photo Return** (returning the official face on file) stops this instantly.

**Issuer Types**

**National Passport Agencies:** (HM Passport Office, U.S. State Dept).
**Consulates / Embassies:** (For Visas and CRBAs).
**International Aviation Bodies:** (ICAO PKD integration).

**Privacy Salt:** ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL. Passport data is the "Crown Jewels" of identity. The hash MUST be salted to prevent foreign intelligence or hackers from "Mass Mapping" a population's travel documents.

## Photo Return: Defeating the "Woman in Cabin 10" Pattern

Verification responses can include the **issuing authority's authoritative photo** of the holder — not just status, but the actual face on file.

**Why This Matters:**
A sophisticated forger can perfectly replicate holograms and security paper. But they **cannot forge what the government server sends back**. When the agent's phone displays the government's photo and it doesn't match the person at the counter, the fraud is exposed. This defeats "Sibling Lending" and sophisticated "Doppelganger" attacks (as dramatized in the 2025 film *The Woman in Cabin 10*).

## Competition vs. NFC (Electronic Passports)

| Feature | OCR-to-Hash | NFC / e-Passport | Scanned PDF / Image |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Bound to the Gov. | **Key-Bound.** Trust the PKI. | **Zero.** Easily forged. |
| **Hardware** | **Universal.** Any smartphone camera. | **Restricted.** Requires NFC chips. | **Universal.** |
| **Adoption** | **High.** Works for older/damaged books. | **Medium.** Many books have dead chips. | **High.** |
| **Integrity** | **Cryptographic.** Binds photo to status. | **High.** | **Vulnerable.** |

**Why OCR wins here:** The "Damaged Chip" reality. Thousands of passports have broken or non-functioning NFC chips due to wear and tear. OCR-to-hash turns the **Durable Printed Page** into a live digital credential, providing "Chip-Level" trust to even the oldest or most battered passport books.
