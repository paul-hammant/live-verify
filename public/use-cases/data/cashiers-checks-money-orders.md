## What is a Cashier's Check?

A **Cashier's Check** is a "Guaranteed Check" written by the bank itself, not by a person. Because the bank takes the money from the sender's account *immediately*, the check is supposedly "as good as cash."

Because people trust them, they are the #1 tool for scammers. Fraudsters create high-quality fake checks to buy cars on Craigslist or to send "overpayments" to victims.

The seller thinks the check is real, hands over the car keys, and then discovers 3 days later that the check was a forgery. Verified hashes allow a seller to scan the check at the curb and see "VERIFIED OUTSTANDING" on the bank's own website *before* handing over the keys.

## Data Verified

Payee name, dollar amount (numerical and text), check/serial number, issuing bank routing number, date of issuance, purchaser name (remitter), memo/reference details.

**Document Types:**
- **Cashier's Check:** Guaranteed by the bank's own funds.
- **Official Check:** Often used for corporate payments.
- **Money Order:** (Western Union, USPS, MoneyGram).
- **Certified Check:** Personal check with bank-guaranteed funds.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (the Bank) and current payment status.

**Status Indications:**
- **Outstanding** — Check is valid and has not yet been cashed.
- **Cleared** — Funds have been paid to the payee.
- **Stop Payment** — Payment blocked (e.g., due to loss/theft).
- **Void** — Re-issued or cancelled by the remitter.

## Second-Party Use

The **Remitter** (Purchaser) benefits from verification.

**Anti-Fraud:** Proving to a seller (e.g., a car seller or landlord) that the check is 100% genuine and the funds are "Verified Outstanding" at the bank. This prevents the seller from being victimized by the common "Fake Cashier's Check" scam.

**Loss Recovery:** Instantly verifying the "Stop Payment" status if the check is lost in the mail, allowing for a faster re-issuance process.

## Third-Party Use

**Attorneys / Escrow Agents**
**Real Estate Closings:** Verifying that the multimillion-dollar cashier's check for a house purchase is real *before* signing over the deed. This stops the most high-stakes form of wire/check fraud in the legal industry.

**Used Car Buyers / Sellers**
**Private Sales:** A seller can scan the check at the curb before handing over the keys and title, ensuring the "Bank Guarantee" is real.

**Banks (Deposit Intake)**
**Risk Reduction:** When a customer deposits a large cashier's check from another bank, the receiving bank can verify it instantly via the hash, allowing them to release the funds faster (reducing the standard 3-5 day "hold" period).

## Verification Architecture

**The "Fake Check" Fraud Problem**

- **High-Quality Forgeries:** Scammers using high-end printers to create near-perfect copies of bank checks. The "Check Number" might be real, but the "Amount" or "Payee" is altered.
- **Closed Accounts:** Issuing a check from an account that is about to be closed.
- **Overpayment Scams:** Sending a fake $5,000 check for a $2,000 item and asking for the $3,000 "difference" to be wired back before the bank realizes the check is fake.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**Retail Banks:** (Wells Fargo, Chase, BofA).
**Postal Services:** (USPS Money Orders).
**Payment Networks:** (Western Union, MoneyGram).

## Jurisdictional Witnessing

A jurisdiction may require the issuer to retain a **witnessing firm** for regulatory compliance. The witnessing firm:

- Receives all hashes from the issuer, and any subsequent changes to the payload as they happen—which may manifest as a new hash, a status change, or even a 404 (record deleted)
- Receives structured content/metadata (key identifiers and dates)
- Does **NOT** receive plaintext or sensitive personal information
- Provides an immutable, timestamped audit trail—available to the jurisdiction on demand, to document holders/third parties during disputes, or as expert witness testimony in legal proceedings

This provides:
- **Non-repudiation:** Issuer cannot deny issuing the document
- **Timestamp proof:** Document existed at a specific time
- **Regulatory audit:** Jurisdictions can inspect the witness ledger for fraud detection
- **Resilience:** Verification works even if issuer's systems go down

**Public Blockchain (Non-Party)**

Witnessing firms may periodically commit rollups to an inexpensive public blockchain, providing an ultimate immutability guarantee. The blockchain is a "non-party"—infrastructure, not a participant in the transaction. This creates multiple verification paths:

1. **Issuer domain** — Direct check against the issuer
2. **Witnessing firm** — Independent confirmation with timestamp
3. **Public blockchain** — Decentralized trust anchor via rollup inclusion


## Competition vs. Positive Pay / Call-In

| Feature | OCR-to-Hash | Positive Pay (Corporate) | Calling the Bank |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **User Access** | **Universal.** Any private seller/landlord. | **Restricted.** Only for big businesses. | **Slow.** Often takes 20+ mins on hold. |
| **Trust** | **Cryptographic.** Bound to the bank domain. | **High.** Direct DB link. | **Human.** Prone to social engineering. |
| **Integrity** | **Binds All Fields.** Payee + Amount + Date. | **High.** | **Vague.** "Yes, check #123 is valid." |
| **Speed** | **Instant.** 5-second scan. | **Fast.** | **Very Slow.** |

**Why OCR wins here:** The "Kitchen Table" transaction. Most cashier's check fraud happens in private transactions where the seller doesn't have access to "Corporate Positive Pay" systems and the bank's fraud department is closed (weekends/evenings). OCR-to-hash provides **24/7, expert-level verification** to anyone with a smartphone.
