## What is a Suitability Report?

When a financial advisor recommends an investment, they must ensure it's suitable for you — considering your financial situation, investment objectives, risk tolerance, and knowledge. The **suitability report** documents this assessment and the rationale for the recommendation.

If things go wrong, this report is critical evidence. Did the advisor understand your circumstances? Did they recommend something appropriate? Disputes often hinge on what was documented at the time.

## Data Verified

**Client name**, **advisor name/credentials**, **firm name**, **report date**, **client profile summary** (risk tolerance, objectives, experience), **recommendation details**, **suitability rationale**.

## Data Visible After Verification

**Status Indications:**
- **On Record** — Suitability report is authenticated as issued
- **Superseded** — Updated advice has been provided
- **Under Review** — Firm is reviewing the advice (possible complaint)
- **Complaint Upheld** — Regulator/ombudsman found the advice unsuitable

## Why This Matters

**Mis-selling scandals:** PPI, endowment mortgages, pension transfers — all involved advice that was documented one way but may have been delivered differently, or was simply unsuitable.

**He-said-she-said:** Without verifiable records, disputes become one party's word against another. Client says "they told me it was low risk"; advisor says "I explained the risks clearly."

Verification proves: this exact suitability assessment existed at this time.

## Jurisdiction Differences

| Jurisdiction | Regulator | Framework | Key Requirements |
|--------------|-----------|-----------|------------------|
| **UK** | FCA | COBS 9 (suitability), Consumer Duty | Suitability report required for personal recommendations |
| **US** | SEC, FINRA | Regulation Best Interest (Reg BI) | "Best interest" standard, Form CRS disclosure |
| **EU** | National + ESMA | MiFID II Article 25 | Suitability assessment, appropriateness test |

US Reg BI is newer (2020) and weaker than UK/EU fiduciary-style requirements, but all require documented rationale.

## Third-Party Use

**Clients** — Verify the advice record matches what they received
**Financial Ombudsman / FINRA arbitration** — Evidence in disputes
**Successor advisors** — Understanding prior advice when taking over a client
**Regulators** — Thematic reviews of advice quality

## Verification Architecture

**The Problem:** Firms may:
- Provide altered suitability reports after complaints arise
- Claim reports existed that were never actually given to clients
- Backdate or modify rationale after investments perform poorly

**The Fix:** Report is hashed at time of delivery. Client receives copy with verification line. If disputed later, both parties can verify the report is exactly what was issued — no alterations, no backdating.
