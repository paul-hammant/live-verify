## What is a Property Tax Assessment?

A **Notice of Property Tax Assessment** is the official government record of a property's value for taxation purposes. It determines the "Ad Valorem" tax that the owner must pay to the county or city.

These documents are "Financial Anchors." Lenders use them to calculate "Escrow Reserves" for mortgages, and they are the primary evidence in **Tax Appeals**. Fraud is common: owners might "edit" an assessment to show a lower value to evade taxes, or conversely, "inflate" the value on a PDF to trick a private lender into thinking the property has more equity than it does. Verified hashes bind the **Assessed Market Value, Taxable Value, and Parcel ID** to the county assessor's domain (e.g., `cookcountyassessor.com` or `maricopa.gov`).

## Data Verified

PIN/Parcel ID number, property owner name, property address, tax year, market value (appraised), assessed value, taxable value (net of exemptions), property class (e.g., Residential/Commercial), township/precinct, date of notice.

**Document Types:**
- **Notice of Assessment:** The preliminary value notification.
- **Final Tax Bill:** (Linked hash) showing the actual dollars due.
- **Exemption Certificate:** Proving eligibility for "Senior" or "Homeowner" discounts.
- **Board of Review Decision:** Proof of a successful tax appeal.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`assessor.county.gov`, `state-tax-portal.gov`) and the valuation standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Verified / Current** — Valuation matches the official county roll for the tax year.
- **Under Appeal** — **ALERT:** The value is currently being contested by the owner.
- **Amended** — **ALERT:** The assessor has corrected the value (e.g., due to a mapping error).
- **Superseded** — A newer assessment for the following tax year exists.

## Second-Party Use

The **Homeowner / Taxpayer** (second party) receives the assessment notice from the county assessor (first party), **keeps it**, and may later hand it to third parties for various reasons, or never do so.

**Personal Record:** They have their own verified copy of the property valuation. Most of the time, the document sits in their files—the verification value is latent, there *if needed*.

**Peace of Mind:** They can confirm at any time that the assessment matches what the county's system recorded and hasn't been altered.

**Future Optionality:** If they file a tax appeal or apply for refinancing, they have cryptographic proof ready without needing to contact the assessor's office.

## Third-Party Use

The homeowner / taxpayer (second party) may hand the verified document to various third parties:

**Mortgage Servicers / Lenders**
**Escrow Reconciliation:** Large banks manage millions of tax payments. OCR-to-hash allows them to bulk-verify assessment notices across 3,000 counties. This ensures they are paying the *correct* tax amount and haven't been sent a "fake bill" by a fraudster.

**Real Estate Data Aggregators (Zillow, Redfin)**
**Data Integrity:** Verifying the "Tax History" data displayed on their websites. Verified hashes ensure the public information is accurate and hasn't been corrupted by legacy data scrapers.

**Tax Consultants / Attorneys**
**Batch Auditing:** Verifying the assessment status of a large commercial portfolio (e.g., 500 warehouses) in minutes rather than manual database lookups.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Value Shrinking" Fraud Problem**

- **Assessment Deflation:** Editing a $1M commercial assessment into a $500k one to pay less tax.
- **Exemption Padding:** Adding a "Disabled Veteran" exemption line to a PDF that the owner didn't actually earn.
- **PIN Swapping:** Using a low-value parcel's assessment notice to cover for a high-value parcel.

**Issuer Types (First Party)**

- County Assessors / Treasurers
- State Departments of Revenue
- Municipal Tax Bureaus

**Privacy Salt:** Not required for standard assessments. Property tax assessments contain many unpredictable variables: unique PIN/parcel numbers (typically long alphanumeric strings), owner names, specific property addresses, exact market values (not round numbers), and tax year combinations. While tax values are public record, the combination of these unique identifiers makes brute-force enumeration infeasible without salt. However, individual exemptions (e.g., Disability/Hardship) should use salted hashes to protect sensitive taxpayer privacy.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing

A jurisdiction may require county assessors to retain a **witnessing firm** for regulatory compliance. The witnessing firm:

- Receives all hashes from the assessor, and any subsequent changes to the payload as they happen—which may manifest as a new hash, a status change (under appeal, amended, superseded), or even a 404 (record deleted)
- Receives structured content/metadata (PIN numbers, market values, taxable values, tax years, classifications)
- Does **NOT** receive plaintext (owner names for sensitive exemptions, appeal justifications)
- Provides an immutable, timestamped audit trail—available to the jurisdiction on demand, to taxpayers/third parties during disputes, or as expert witness testimony in legal proceedings

This provides:
- **Non-repudiation:** Assessor cannot deny issuing the valuation
- **Timestamp proof:** Hash existed at a specific time
- **Regulatory audit:** State revenue departments can inspect the witness ledger for assessment patterns
- **Resilience:** Verification works even if county's systems go down

**Public Blockchain (Non-Party)**

Witnessing firms may periodically commit rollups to an inexpensive public blockchain, providing an ultimate immutability guarantee. The blockchain is a "non-party"—infrastructure, not a participant in the transaction. This creates multiple verification paths:

1. **Assessor domain** — Direct check against the issuer
2. **Witnessing firm** — Independent confirmation with timestamp
3. **Public blockchain** — Decentralized trust anchor via rollup inclusion

## Rationale

Property tax is the "Financial Bedrock" of local government. By turning assessment notices into verifiable digital bridges, we protect the public revenue and ensure that the "Fair Share" of every citizen is based on the digital truth of the law.
