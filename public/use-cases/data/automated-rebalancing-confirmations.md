## What is Automated Rebalancing?

If you use a "Robo-Advisor" (like Wealthfront or Betterment), a computer program manages your money. If your stocks go up too much, the computer automatically sells some and buys bonds to keep your risk level steady.

This often involves "Tax-Loss Harvesting"—selling a losing stock just to capture a tax break, then immediately buying something similar.

These trades happen by the thousands every second. An **Automated Rebalancing Confirmation** is your receipt. It proves to the IRS that these trades were legitimate algorithmic moves and not a "wash sale" (an illegal tax dodge).

Hello Sarah Connor,

Your portfolio was automatically rebalanced today to maintain your
9.0/10 risk score and capture tax-loss harvesting opportunities.

## Data Verified

Account holder name, transaction date, securities sold/bought, tax-lot identification, net gain/loss realized, tax-loss harvesting (TLH) status, risk score at time of trade.

**Document Types:**
- **Rebalancing Confirmation:** Details of the specific algorithm-driven trades.
- **Tax-Loss Harvesting Summary:** Annual proof of realized losses for IRS reporting.
- **Drift Report:** Explaining why rebalancing was triggered (e.g., asset class exceeded 5% drift).

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`wealthfront.com`, `betterment.com`) and the status of the trade.

**Status Indications:**
- **Executed** — Trades completed and settled.
- **Cancelled** — Trade was blocked (e.g., due to wash-sale rule detection).
- **Corrected** — Original confirmation was adjusted (rare).

## Second-Party Use

The **Investor** (second party) receives the rebalancing confirmation from the robo-advisor (first party), **keeps it**, and may later hand it to third parties for various reasons, or never do so.

**Personal Record:** The investor has their own verified copy of automated trades. Most of the time, the document sits in their investment records—the verification value is latent, there *if needed*.

**Peace of Mind:** The investor can confirm at any time that the confirmation matches what the platform's system recorded and hasn't been altered since they received it.

**Future Optionality:** If an IRS audit arises, a dispute about algorithm performance occurs, or a lender needs to verify asset movements, the investor has cryptographic proof ready without needing to contact the robo-advisor.

## Third-Party Use

The investor (second party) may hand the verified document to various third parties:

**The IRS / Tax Authorities**
Verifying that the automated platform correctly identified "Substantially Identical" securities (e.g., switching from VTI to ITOT) and didn't trigger a wash sale violation.

**Mortgage Lenders**
Lenders analyzing "Source of Downpayment" often see thousands of small trades in robo-advisor accounts. Verified confirmations simplify the review of capital gains/losses impacting the borrower's cash position.

**FINRA / SEC Regulators**
Regulators can verify that the trades described in the investor's confirmation match the actual execution logs of the firm, ensuring the algorithm is operating as described in the prospectus.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Tax Fraud" Problem**

- **Fabricated Losses:** Investors manually creating fake "trade confirmations" showing losses to offset real gains on their tax return.
- **Hiding Gains:** Editing a confirmation to turn a $10,000 gain into a $10,000 loss before sending records to an accountant or the IRS.
- **Wash-Sale Concealment:** Deleting the "Purchase" leg of a trade to hide that a loss was immediately disqualified by a repurchase.

**Issuer Types (First Party)**

- Robo-Advisors (Wealthfront, Betterment, Acorns)
- Traditional Firms (Vanguard Personal Advisor, Schwab Intelligent Portfolios)

**Privacy Salt:** Not required. Rebalancing confirmations contain highly unpredictable variables—unique account numbers, specific transaction IDs, precise dates and timestamps, investor names, exact security tickers, specific share quantities, and detailed gain/loss calculations with many decimal places. These elements combined provide sufficient entropy that enumeration attacks are infeasible. Adding salt would provide no additional security benefit.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing

A jurisdiction may require robo-advisors to retain a **witnessing firm** for regulatory compliance. The witnessing firm:

- Receives all hashes from the robo-advisor, and any subsequent changes to the payload as they happen—which may manifest as a new hash, a status change (cancelled, corrected), or even a 404 (record deleted)
- Receives structured content/metadata (account IDs, transaction dates, securities traded, gain/loss amounts)
- Does **NOT** receive plaintext (investor names, account balances, personal financial details)
- Provides an immutable, timestamped audit trail—available to the jurisdiction on demand, to investors/third parties during disputes, or as expert witness testimony in legal proceedings

This provides:
- **Non-repudiation:** Robo-advisor cannot deny executing the rebalancing trades
- **Timestamp proof:** Trades occurred at a specific time (critical for tax-loss harvesting timing)
- **Regulatory audit:** SEC/FINRA can inspect the witness ledger for algorithm compliance
- **Resilience:** Verification works even if robo-advisor's systems go down

**Public Blockchain (Non-Party)**

Witnessing firms may periodically commit rollups to an inexpensive public blockchain, providing an ultimate immutability guarantee. The blockchain is a "non-party"—infrastructure, not a participant in the transaction. This creates multiple verification paths:

1. **Robo-advisor domain** — Direct check against the issuer
2. **Witnessing firm** — Independent confirmation with timestamp
3. **Public blockchain** — Decentralized trust anchor via rollup inclusion

## Competition vs. 1099-B Forms

| Feature | OCR-to-Hash | Annual 1099-B | Monthly Statement |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Timeliness** | **Real-time.** Proves the loss *today*. | **Annual.** Only available in February of the next year. | **Monthly.** |
| **Detail** | **High.** Explains the *reason* (Rebalancing/TLH). | **Low.** Just shows Cost Basis and Proceeds. | **Medium.** |
| **Trust** | **Cryptographic.** Binds to the firm's domain. | **High.** Official tax document. | **Medium.** Easily forged. |

**Why OCR wins here:** Rebalancing happens all year round. Waiting for a 1099-B to prove a strategy is risky. OCR-to-hash allows for **intra-year verification** of tax strategies, which is crucial for high-net-worth individuals doing complex planning or responding to "Mid-Year" tax inquiries.
