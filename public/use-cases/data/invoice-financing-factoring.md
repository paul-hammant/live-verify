## Data Verified

Seller (client) name, Buyer (debtor) name, Invoice number, total invoice amount, advance rate %, cash advance amount, factor fee structure, date of purchase, notice of assignment (remit-to) bank details.

**Document Types:**
- **Factoring Confirmation:** The "Receipt" for the cash advance.
- **Notice of Assignment (NOA):** The legal letter sent to the buyer.
- **Verification of Debt (VOD):** (Linked hash) where the buyer confirms the invoice is real.
- **UCC-1 Filing Extract:** Proving the factor's legal lien on the assets.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`bluevine.com`, `fundbox.com`) and current asset status.

**Status Indications:**
- **Advanced** — Factor has purchased the invoice and paid the seller.
- **Paid** — Buyer has settled the invoice with the factor.
- **In-Dispute** — Buyer has challenged the goods/invoice quality.
- **Void** — Transaction reversed; seller repurchased the invoice.

## Second-Party Use

The **Seller (Small Business)** benefits from verification.

**Line of Credit Extension:** Proving to their primary bank that their "Accounts Receivable" are verified assets that have already been vetted by a major factoring firm. This allows the business to get higher credit limits by demonstrating a "Verified Liquid" balance sheet.

**Vendor Assurance:** Proving to a raw material supplier that they have the verified "Cash Advance" coming, ensuring the supplier continues to ship the next batch of parts.

## Third-Party Use

**The Debtor (Buyer's Accounts Payable)**
**Remit-to Integrity:** When a buyer receives a "Notice of Assignment" telling them to pay a different bank, they are often terrified of wire fraud. OCR-to-hash allows the AP clerk to verify the NOA against the Factor's domain. "Verified by BlueVine" ensures the buyer isn't paying a hacker.

**Alternative Lenders**
**Lien Vetting:** Ensuring that an invoice isn't being "Double Factored" (sold to two different firms). A verified hash proves who currently owns the legal right to the cash.

**External Auditors**
**Existence of Assets:** Verifying the "Advance Rate" and "Reserve Fund" totals during a corporate audit.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Double Factoring" Fraud Problem**

- **Double-Financing:** A dishonest seller selling the same $100,000 invoice to two different factoring companies. OCR-to-hash allows factors to check the hash status of an invoice ID across a shared (or individual) domain index.
- **Amount Inflation:** Editing a $10,000 invoice PDF to read $100,000 to get a larger cash advance.
- **Fake NOAs:** Hackers creating fake assignment letters to redirect payments from a legitimate factor to a private criminal wallet.

**Issuer Types**

**Fintech Factors:** (BlueVine, Fundbox, FundThrough).
**Commercial Banks.**
**UCC-1 Registries:** (Hosting the verified lien hashes).

## Competition vs. Manual VOD Calls

| Feature | OCR-to-Hash | Manual VOD (Phone/Email) | Scanned PDF NOA |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Bound to the Factor. | **Human.** Prone to social engineering or "fake buyers." | **Zero.** Easily forged. |
| **Speed** | **Instant.** 5-second scan. | **Slow.** Often takes 3-5 days to reach the buyer's AP manager. | **Instant.** |
| **Integrity** | **Cryptographic.** Binds the *Bank Details*. | **Vague.** "Yes, we will pay that invoice." | **Vulnerable.** |
| **Privacy** | **High.** Share only the *NOA*. | **Low.** Calls reveal the seller's cash situation. | **Vulnerable.** |

**Why OCR wins here:** The "Wire Fraud" reality. Accounts Payable clerks are being trained to **ignore** email-based bank detail changes. They demand "Independent Verification." OCR-to-hash turns the **Assignment Letter** into a live, high-authority digital proof that allows the buyer to pay the factor with 100% confidence.
