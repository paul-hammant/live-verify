## Data Verified

Donor name, date of birth, ABO blood group, Rh factor (Positive/Negative), Donor ID number, specific phenotypes/antibodies (if relevant), last donation date, screening status (e.g., CMV negative).

**Document Types:**
- **Donor Card:** Standard wallet card for regular donors.
- **Blood Type Certificate:** Official clinical document from a lab.
- **Military Dog Tag Extract:** Verified blood type for service members.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`redcross.org`, `labcorp.com`) and the verified donor data.

**Status Indications:**
- **Active** — Donor record is valid and current.
- **Restricted** — (For donors) Temporary or permanent deferral from donating.
- **Updated** — New testing has refined the blood type profile (e.g., rare sub-type identified).

## Second-Party Use

The **Patient / Donor** benefits from verification.

**Emergency Information:** Proving their blood type to an emergency responder or overseas clinic. While hospitals always cross-match, having a verified, trusted "O-Negative" claim can speed up the preparation of emergency "Universal" blood units in trauma cases.

**Travel Safety:** Carrying a verified card when traveling in developing nations where blood banking systems are less integrated.

**Donation Efficiency:** Speeding up the intake process at a blood drive by providing a verified link to their previous donor record.

## Third-Party Use

**Emergency Medical Services (EMS)**
**Field Triage:** In a mass casualty event, paramedics can scan cards to prioritize "Universal Donors" (O-Neg) for field use or to relay patient types to the trauma center ahead of arrival.

**Sports Teams / Expedition Leads**
**Safety Protocol:** Coaches and expedition leaders maintaining verified blood type records for team members in high-risk environments (e.g., mountain climbing or professional racing).

**Insurance Companies**
**Critical Care Coverage:** Verifying foundational health markers as part of high-value life or disability underwriting.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Inaccurate Info" Problem**

- **Self-Reported Errors:** People often misremember their blood type (e.g., thinking they are O-Pos when they are A-Pos). A fake card based on memory can lead to dangerous medical assumptions.
- **Altered Screening:** Removing a "CMV Positive" or other health marker notation from a card to bypass donation restrictions.
- **Fabricated Certificates:** Forging a "Rare Blood Type" certificate to gain priority access or special medical attention.

**Issuer Types**

**Blood Banks:** (Red Cross, Vitalant).
**Clinical Labs:** (Quest, LabCorp).
**Military Branches:** (For service member medical data).

**Privacy Salt:** Highly critical. Blood type is sensitive PHI. The hash must be salted to prevent "Guess-and-Check" attacks to find specific people's blood types.

## Competition vs. Electronic Medical Records (EMR)

| Feature | OCR-to-Hash | EMR / Epic MyChart | Tattoo / Engraved ID |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Offline Access** | **Strong.** Card is always with the patient. | **Fragile.** Requires hospital to have system access. | **Strong.** But non-verifiable. |
| **Integrity** | **Cryptographic.** Bound to the Lab. | **High.** Direct from DB. | **Zero.** Can be wrong/fake. |
| **Interoperability** | **Universal.** Red Cross card works in a London hospital. | **Low.** US systems often don't talk to international ones. | **Universal.** |
| **Detail** | **Full.** Can link to full donor profile. | **Full.** | **Minimal.** Just the type. |

**Why OCR wins here:** The "Disconnected Emergency." In a major disaster or in a remote area, hospital systems go down. A physical card that *proves* its own authenticity via a domain link (verifiable once cell signal returns) is the ultimate safety bridge between the physical and digital medical worlds.
