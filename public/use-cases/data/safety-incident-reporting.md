## What is Safety Incident Reporting?

Every high-risk industry has learned the same lesson: **punishing reporters kills reporting, and killing reporting kills people.** Aviation, nuclear, rail, maritime, construction, chemical—all have evolved toward blameless reporting systems where fast disclosure enables learning.

Verified incident reports create immutable records that can't be quietly deleted when inconvenient.

## The Universal Lesson

Every industry that handles dangerous systems has learned:

| Punitive Culture | Blameless Culture |
|------------------|-------------------|
| Errors hidden | Errors reported |
| Near-misses buried | Near-misses = free lessons |
| Problems fester | Problems surface early |
| Catastrophic failures | Incremental improvements |
| Litigation discovers coverups | Fast disclosure limits liability |

**Verification enforces blameless culture:** Reports are timestamped and immutable. You can't delete an inconvenient report. Missing reports for known incidents become discoverable gaps.

## Data Verified

Reporting organization, incident category, date/time, severity, immediate cause, contributing factors, injuries/damage, corrective actions, regulatory notification timestamps.

**Industry-Specific Document Types:**

**Aviation:**
- ASRS reports (NASA, de-identified, immunity)
- Mandatory Occurrence Reports (MOR)
- Service Difficulty Reports (SDR)
- Accident/Incident reports (NTSB)

**Nuclear:**
- Event Notifications (NRC, 4/8-hour requirements)
- Licensee Event Reports (LER)
- Operating Experience reports (INPO)

**Rail:**
- C3RS Close Call reports (confidential)
- FRA Accident/Incident reports
- Positive Train Control interventions

**Maritime:**
- Marine Casualty Reports (Coast Guard)
- Port State Control deficiencies
- ISM Code non-conformities

**Construction/Industrial:**
- OSHA 300 Log entries
- OSHA Form 301 (individual incidents)
- Near-miss reports (voluntary)
- JSA/JHA deviations

**Chemical:**
- RMP (Risk Management Plan) incidents
- EPCRA releases (Superfund)
- PSM (Process Safety Management) incidents
- CSB-reportable events

**Cybersecurity:**
- CISA incident reports (72-hour requirement)
- State breach notifications
- SEC cyber disclosure (public companies)

**Food Safety:**
- FDA adverse event reports
- USDA FSIS incidents
- Recall notifications

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (regulator, reporting system) and report status.

**Status Indications:**
- **Filed** — Report submitted and timestamped
- **Acknowledged** — Regulatory body confirmed receipt
- **Investigation Open** — Analysis in progress
- **Investigation Complete** — Findings documented
- **Corrective Actions Verified** — Fixes implemented and confirmed
- **Closed** — Full cycle complete

## The Confidentiality Spectrum

Different systems offer different protections:

**Full De-identification (ASRS):**
NASA strips all identifying information. Reporter gets immunity from FAA enforcement. Maximum reporting, maximum learning, no individual accountability.

**Confidential but Traceable (C3RS):**
FRA can't use reports for enforcement, but they're not fully de-identified. Balanced approach.

**Identified but Protected (PSO):**
Patient Safety Organizations provide legal privilege. Reports are identified but can't be used in litigation.

**Fully Transparent (OSHA 300):**
Public record. Anyone can see. Regulatory enforcement possible.

**Verification works across the spectrum:** Even de-identified reports get timestamped hashes proving when they were filed.

## Second-Party Use

The **Reporting Organization** benefits from verification.

**Compliance Proof:** "We reported within 4 hours as required—here's the cryptographic timestamp."

**Litigation Defense:** Fast, verified disclosure defeats claims of concealment.

**Insurance:** Demonstrated reporting culture may reduce premiums.

**Regulatory Standing:** Pattern of thorough reporting builds credibility with regulators.

## Third-Party Use

**Regulators (FAA, NRC, OSHA, Coast Guard, EPA, CISA)**
**Compliance Monitoring:** Verify reporting timelines were met.

**Industry Associations**
**Benchmarking:** Compare reporting volumes across members (more = healthier culture).

**Insurers**
**Risk Assessment:** Verified reporting patterns inform underwriting.

**Researchers**
**Safety Science:** Verified, timestamped incident data enables population studies.

**Unions / Worker Representatives**
**Safety Advocacy:** Verify that incidents are being reported, not suppressed.

**Journalists / Investigators**
**Accountability:** Verify claims about when organizations knew about problems.

## Verification Architecture

**Time-Critical Requirements**

Many incidents have strict notification deadlines:
- Nuclear: 4 hours / 8 hours / 24 hours (by severity)
- CISA cyber: 72 hours
- EPA chemical release: Immediate
- Coast Guard marine casualty: Immediate
- OSHA fatality: 8 hours

Verified timestamps prove whether deadlines were met.

**Chain of Reports**

Major incidents generate multiple linked reports:
```
Initial Notification (4-hour)
    verify:nrc.gov/event/EN-56847-initial

→ Follow-up Report (60-day)
    verify:nrc.gov/event/EN-56847-followup

→ Licensee Event Report (LER)
    verify:nrc.gov/ler/05000123-2026-001

→ Corrective Action Verification
    verify:nrc.gov/ca/05000123-2026-001
```

Each step independently verifiable. Gaps are visible.

**Anonymous + Timestamped**

Even fully de-identified reports (ASRS) benefit from verification:
- Proves the report was filed on claimed date
- Prevents backdating after incidents become public
- Creates aggregate statistics on reporting culture

## Cross-Industry Learning

The same incident patterns appear everywhere:

| Pattern | Aviation | Nuclear | Construction | Healthcare |
|---------|----------|---------|--------------|------------|
| Fatigue | Pilot duty limits | Operator overtime | Long shifts | Resident hours |
| Handoffs | Crew changes | Shift turnover | Trade coordination | Nurse handoffs |
| Procedure violations | Checklist deviations | Tech spec violations | JSA shortcuts | Protocol bypasses |
| Communication | Radio confusion | Control room noise | Language barriers | Handoff errors |

Verified incident data enables cross-industry pattern recognition.

## Novel Applications

**Real-Time Safety Dashboards**
Public-facing displays of verified incident rates. Customers, workers, communities can see safety performance.

**Predictive Analytics**
Machine learning on verified near-miss data to predict and prevent serious incidents.

**Supply Chain Safety Scoring**
Aggregate verified incident rates across suppliers. Procurement decisions informed by safety culture.

**Worker Mobility**
Safety certifications that follow workers across employers, with verified training and incident history.

**Community Right-to-Know**
Verified chemical release and environmental incident data for communities near industrial facilities.
