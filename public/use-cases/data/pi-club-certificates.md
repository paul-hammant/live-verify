## What is a P&I Certificate?

In the world of giant cargo ships, "Normal" insurance isn't enough. Shipowners join a **P&I Club** (Protection & Indemnity)—a group of owners who share the risk of massive disasters like oil spills or ship collisions.

The **Certificate of Entry** is the ship's "Unlimited Credit Card" for liability. It is the only paper that port authorities will accept before allowing a $100 million tanker to dock.

Thieves use "Fake P&I Papers" to sneak dangerous or uninsured ships into ports. Verified hashes allow a harbor master to scan the certificate and see the **verified $1 billion+ coverage** on the Club's official domain in seconds.

## Verification Architecture

**The Protection & Indemnity (P&I) club certificates Fraud Problem**

Document fraud creates significant risks:

- **Fabrication:** Entirely fake documents created from scratch
- **Alteration:** Genuine documents with modified content (dates, amounts, names)
- **Impersonation:** Documents falsely claiming to be from legitimate issuers
- **Expired/Revoked Documents:** Presenting invalid documents as current

OCR-to-hash verification addresses fake and altered documents. Domain binding confirms the claimed issuer actually issued the document.

**Issuer Types**

Who issues these documents and operates verification endpoints?

**Primary Issuers:** Organizations with direct authority to issue these documents.

**Licensed Professionals:** Professionals authorized to create and certify documents.

**Government Agencies:** Federal, state, or local agencies with jurisdiction.

**Industry Bodies:** Trade associations and professional organizations.

**System Integration**

Verification integrates with relevant systems:

**Issuer Systems:** Core operational systems generate verification hashes at document creation.

**Industry Standards:** Existing data standards extended to include verification.

**Regulatory Systems:** Government databases for systematic hash receipt and oversight.

**Third-Party Platforms:** Industry portals and platforms enable verification access.

## Rationale

Prevents fake P&I certificates. Domain binding verifies International Group P&I club. Extremely high limits ($1bn+ pollution/collision liability). Port state control verification. Oil Pollution Act (OPA 90) compliance. Long claims tail.
