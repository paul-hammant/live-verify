## What is a 1031 Exchange?

In US tax law, if you sell an investment property for a profit, you usually pay capital gains tax. However, under **Section 1031**, you can defer these taxes if you reinvest the money into a new property.

The catch? strict rules:
1.  **The Intermediary:** You cannot touch the cash. A neutral third party (Qualified Intermediary or **QI**) must hold the funds.
2.  **The 45-Day Rule:** You must identify potential new properties within 45 days of selling the old one.

This document is the **Identification Form**. It acts as a timestamped "snapshot" proving the investor met the 45-day deadline.

## Data Verified

Exchanger name, relinquished property address, date of transfer, identified replacement properties (addresses and fair market values), identification date, Qualified Intermediary (QI) name and license.

**Document Types:**
- **Identification of Replacement Property** (45-day rule compliance)
- **Exchange Agreement**
- **Closing Statements** (HUD-1/ALTA) for both legs
- **Qualified Intermediary Resignation/Assignment**

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (the Qualified Intermediary) and the responder text.

**Status Indications:**
- **Valid** — Document authentic, QI confirms structure is active/completed.
- **Void** — Exchange failed or was cancelled.
- **Amended** — Superseded by a later identification form (within the 45-day window).

## Second-Party Use

The **Exchanger** (second party) receives the identification form from the Qualified Intermediary (first party), **keeps it**, and may later hand it to third parties for various reasons, or never do so.

**Personal Record:** The exchanger has their own verified copy of the 45-day identification. Most of the time, the document sits in their tax files—the verification value is latent, there *if needed*.

**Peace of Mind:** The exchanger can confirm at any time that the form matches what the QI's system recorded and hasn't been altered since they received it.

**Future Optionality:** If an IRS audit arises 3 years later, the exchanger has cryptographic proof ready without needing to contact the QI, preventing the IRS from disqualifying the exchange for "backdating" documents.

## Third-Party Use

The exchanger (second party) may hand the verified document to various third parties:

**IRS and Tax Authorities**
Agents can instantly verify the authenticity and timestamp of the identification form. 1031 exchanges are high-risk audit targets; verifying that the identification list wasn't fabricated retroactively is a primary check.

**Lenders and Financial Institutions**
Underwriters need to verify that large incoming wires are non-debt funds from a property sale. Verified 1031 docs prove the source and tax-deferred status (impacting debt-to-income ratios since capital gains tax isn't due).

**Title and Escrow Companies**
Closing agents must follow strict instructions from the QI. Verifying the exchange agreement ensures they are paying the proceeds to the QI, not the seller (which would bust the exchange).

## Verification Architecture

**The 1031 Exchange Fraud Problem**

- **Backdating:** The most common fraud. Taxpayers missing the 45-day identification deadline and creating a document dated earlier.
- **Fake QIs:** Fraudsters setting up fake QI websites to steal exchange funds (which must be held by a third party).
- **Alteration:** Changing the property list after the fact to include the property actually purchased.

**Issuer Types (First Party)**

- Qualified Intermediaries (QIs) — Specialized non-bank financial institutions that hold funds
- Exchange Accommodators — Entities handling reverse exchanges

**Privacy Salt:** Required. Unlike documents with many unpredictable variables, 1031 identification forms contain enumerable values—standard property addresses, round dollar fair market values, and publicly recorded real estate transactions. A competitor or tax authority could feasibly enumerate combinations to reverse-engineer a taxpayer's investment strategy. Salt protects the privacy of the specific properties being considered.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing

A jurisdiction may require Qualified Intermediaries to retain a **witnessing firm** for regulatory compliance. The witnessing firm:

- Receives all hashes from the QI, and any subsequent changes to the payload as they happen—which may manifest as a new hash, a status change (void, amended), or even a 404 (record deleted)
- Receives structured content/metadata (exchanger name, property addresses, identification dates, fair market values)
- Does **NOT** receive plaintext (social security numbers, bank account details)
- Provides an immutable, timestamped audit trail—available to the jurisdiction on demand, to exchangers/third parties during disputes, or as expert witness testimony in legal proceedings

This provides:
- **Non-repudiation:** QI cannot deny issuing the identification form
- **Timestamp proof:** Form existed at a specific time (critical for 45-day deadline compliance)
- **Regulatory audit:** IRS can inspect the witness ledger for backdating fraud
- **Resilience:** Verification works even if QI's systems go down or the QI goes out of business

**Public Blockchain (Non-Party)**

Witnessing firms may periodically commit rollups to an inexpensive public blockchain, providing an ultimate immutability guarantee. The blockchain is a "non-party"—infrastructure, not a participant in the transaction. This creates multiple verification paths:

1. **QI domain** — Direct check against the issuer
2. **Witnessing firm** — Independent confirmation with timestamp
3. **Public blockchain** — Decentralized trust anchor via rollup inclusion

## Competition vs. QR/NFC

| Feature | OCR-to-Hash | QR Code |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Audit Trail** | **Superior.** The paper document itself is the artifact. The hash proves the *content* of the paper existed at the timestamp. | **Weak.** QR codes are often just links. They don't inherently prove the *text* surrounding them hasn't changed unless the QR contains the full text (too large). |
| **Professionalism** | **High.** A discreet `verify:` line at the bottom of a legal letter looks standard. | **Low.** A giant QR code on a formal legal designation letter looks out of place. |
| **Longevity** | **High.** Text is durable. | **Medium.** QR codes can be damaged by folding, stapling, or scanning/copying degradation. |
| **Privacy** | **High.** No data leaked until the specific hash is queried. | **Variable.** If the QR encodes the data, anyone with a camera can read it instantly without an audit trail. |

**Why OCR wins here:** 1031 documents are heavily scrutinized legal instruments. They need to look like contracts, not shipping labels. The primary "user" is often an IRS auditor years later, working from a scanned PDF or photocopy where a QR code might be illegible, but text is readable and re-typable if needed.
