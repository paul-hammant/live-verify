## Verification Value

**Problem:** Fake permits posted to:
- Avoid permit fees and inspections
- Perform unlicensed work
- Deceive neighbors about project scope
- Create appearance of legitimacy for scam contractors

**Solution:** OCR-to-hash lets anyone (neighbors, inspectors, potential buyers) verify a posted permit is genuine by scanning it with their phone.
