## What is an Employment Reference?

A verified employment reference proves you actually worked somewhere. It can appear as an addendum to a CV/resume, in an email after a job offer, or as a standalone VOE letter.

Fraud is common: "Reference Mills" sell fake employment letters. Live Verify connects the verifier directly to the real employer's domain.

## Data Verified

Employee name, legal employer name, job title/role, start date, end date (or "Present"), rehire eligibility status, reason for departure (voluntary/involuntary), salary (optional/linked hash), HRIS reference ID.

**Document Types:**
- **Verification of Employment (VOE):** Standard 1-page form.
- **Reference Letter:** Narrative letter from a supervisor.
- **Experience Certificate:** (Common in India/Middle East).
- **Separation Notice:** Final proof of departure.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`acme-corp.com`, `workday.com`) and current worker standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Verified** — Record matches the company's official HRIS file.
- **Revoked** — Reference withdrawn (e.g., discovery of post-departure misconduct).
- **Superseded** — Replaced by a corrected version (e.g., date correction).
- **Fraud Alert** — **ALERT:** Reference ID associated with a known "Reference Mill."

## Second-Party Use

The **Employee (Applicant)** benefits from verification.

**Background Check Speed:** Proving their work history instantly to a new employer. A verified hash allows the recruiter to skip the "Manual Phone Tag" with HR departments, reducing the time-to-hire from 10 days to 10 seconds.

**Mortgage Approval:** Proving income stability to a lender. Banks often reject VOE letters if the phone number on the letterhead doesn't match a Google search. A verified hash from the corporate domain removes this doubt.

## Third-Party Use

**Hiring Managers / Recruiters**
**Fraud Prevention:** Nanny/Reference mills sell fake employment letters for a fee. Live Verify connects the recruiter directly to the real employer's domain, stopping "Fake Resume" fraud at the source.

**Background Check Firms (Checkr / Sterling)**
**Automation:** Firms can use the verification hash to automatically clear employment history checks, significantly lowering their manual labor costs.

**Immigration Authorities**
**Work Visa Vetting:** Verifying the "Specialty Occupation" claims of an H-1B or L-1 applicant by confirming their prior job titles and duties against the employer's verified record.

## Peer References

Unlike formal VOE letters from HR departments, **peer references** are colleague-to-colleague attestations—similar to LinkedIn recommendations but cryptographically verifiable. See [prior art discussion of mine](https://gist.github.com/paul-hammant/3375fec8e204f0c7567d4daea1fe48ef).

The verify URL points to the *referee's* domain, not the employer's. This reflects that the claim is personal ("I worked with this person") rather than institutional ("This person was employed here").

**Use Cases:**
- **Professional Networking:** A former colleague attests to working with you, verifiable against their personal site.
- **Freelance/Contract Work:** When no formal HR department exists, peers can vouch for project collaboration.
- **Reference Chains:** Multiple peer attestations from different people build a web of trust.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Reference Mill" Fraud Problem**

- **Fabricated Letters:** Entirely fake companies (with real-looking websites) providing fake references for a fee.
- **Title Inflation:** Changing "Junior Intern" to "Senior Lead" on a PDF to get a higher salary at a new job.
- **Date Stretching:** Altering a 3-month tenure to look like a 3-year tenure.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**Corporations:** (e.g., Google, Amazon, local SMBs).
**HRIS Platforms:** (Workday, SAP SuccessFactors, ADP).
**Verification Utilities:** (The Work Number / Equifax).

**Privacy Salt:** Critical. Employment data is sensitive. The hash must be salted to prevent "Guessing" names of employees to see their departure reasons.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing

A jurisdiction may require the issuer to retain a **witnessing firm** for regulatory compliance. The witnessing firm:

- Receives all hashes from the issuer, and any subsequent changes to the payload as they happen—which may manifest as a new hash, a status change, or even a 404 (record deleted)
- Receives structured content/metadata (key identifiers and dates)
- Does **NOT** receive plaintext or sensitive personal information
- Provides an immutable, timestamped audit trail—available to the jurisdiction on demand, to document holders/third parties during disputes, or as expert witness testimony in legal proceedings

This provides:
- **Non-repudiation:** Issuer cannot deny issuing the document
- **Timestamp proof:** Document existed at a specific time
- **Regulatory audit:** Jurisdictions can inspect the witness ledger for fraud detection
- **Resilience:** Verification works even if issuer's systems go down

**Public Blockchain (Non-Party)**

Witnessing firms may periodically commit rollups to an inexpensive public blockchain, providing an ultimate immutability guarantee. The blockchain is a "non-party"—infrastructure, not a participant in the transaction. This creates multiple verification paths:

1. **Issuer domain** — Direct check against the issuer
2. **Witnessing firm** — Independent confirmation with timestamp
3. **Public blockchain** — Decentralized trust anchor via rollup inclusion


## Competition vs. The Work Number (Equifax)

| Feature | Live Verify | The Work Number | Manual Phone Check |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **User Privacy** | **High.** Employee controls the document share. | **Low.** Lenders see full historical data pool. | **Medium.** |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Bound to the Employer. | **Data-Bound.** Trust the aggregator. | **Human.** Prone to social engineering. |
| **Interoperability** | **Universal.** Works for any company with a URL. | **Limited.** Only for large firms who pay for TWN. | **Universal.** |
| **Cost** | **Low.** Standard web infra. | **Very High.** Lenders pay $50-$100 per check. | **High.** Costs in human time. |

**Why Live Verify wins here:** Reach. Small and medium businesses (SMBs) aren't on The Work Number. They rely on "Persistent Paper" reference letters. Live Verify allows a small 5-person law firm or a local bakery to provide the same level of cryptographic trust as a Fortune 500 company.
