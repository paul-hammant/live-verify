## What is a Consent Record?

Consent is given, withdrawn, modified—but rarely documented with verifiable precision. A **Consent Record** captures exactly what was consented to, when, by whom, and preserves that moment immutably.

"Did they consent?" becomes answerable with cryptographic proof.

## Why Consent Records Matter

**Disputes:** "I never agreed to that" vs. "Here's the verified consent record with exact terms."

**Compliance:** GDPR, HIPAA, CCPA all require demonstrable consent. Verified records prove compliance.

**Audit Trails:** Regulators can verify consent was obtained properly, with correct disclosures.

**Withdrawal Tracking:** Consent given can be withdrawn. Both events need verification.

## Data Verified

Consenting party (or hash), receiving party, scope of consent (what's being consented to), version of terms/disclosures, timestamp, method of consent, witness (if applicable).

**Document Types:**
- **Medical Informed Consent:** Procedure-specific with risks disclosed
- **Data Processing Consent:** GDPR/CCPA granular permissions
- **Research Consent:** IRB-approved study participation
- **Parental Consent:** Minor's activities with guardian approval
- **Terms Acceptance:** Software/service agreement acknowledgment
- **Consent Withdrawal:** Revocation of previous consent
- **Consent Modification:** Partial changes to existing consent

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (organization that obtained consent) and consent status.

**Status Indications:**
- **Active** — Consent currently in effect
- **Withdrawn** — Consent has been revoked
- **Expired** — Time-limited consent has lapsed
- **Superseded** — Replaced by newer consent (e.g., updated terms)
- **Partial** — Some elements withdrawn, others remain

## Second-Party Use

The **Consenting Party** benefits from verification.

**Receipt:** Proof of what was consented to (and what wasn't).

**Withdrawal Confirmation:** Verified proof that consent was revoked.

**Terms Reference:** "What did I actually agree to?" is now answerable.

## Third-Party Use

**Regulators**
**Compliance Audits:** Verify that proper consent was obtained before processing.

**Courts**
**Contract Disputes:** Verified consent record proves agreement to terms.

**Data Protection Officers**
**GDPR Compliance:** Demonstrate consent basis for each processing activity.

**Institutional Review Boards**
**Research Oversight:** Verify proper informed consent for study participants.

## Verification Architecture

**Granularity**

Consent isn't binary. Records capture specific permissions:
- Email marketing: YES
- Third-party sharing: NO
- Profiling: NO

Each element is part of the verified record.

**Version Binding**

Consent is to a *specific version* of terms. The record includes:
- Version identifier
- Hash of the full document
- Link to archived full text

"They changed the terms after I agreed" is now provable.

**Withdrawal as First-Class Record**

Withdrawal gets its own verification:
- References original consent
- Specifies scope (all or partial)
- Triggers deletion obligations

The original consent verification then returns "WITHDRAWN" status.

**Consent Chains**

Some consents are layered:
- Organization consents to platform terms
- Employee consents to organization policy
- Customer consents to employee interaction

Each level is independently verifiable.

## Novel Applications

**Consent Management Platforms**
Centralized dashboards showing all verified consents with status.

**Automated Compliance**
Systems that check consent records before processing, refusing if consent is withdrawn or expired.

**Consent Portability**
User carries verified consent records between services, proving preferences.

**Consent Receipts**
Automatic generation of verifiable receipt when consent is given, for user's records.


## Jurisdictional Witnessing

A jurisdiction may require the issuer to retain a **witnessing firm** for regulatory compliance. The witnessing firm:

- Receives all hashes from the issuer, and any subsequent changes to the payload as they happen—which may manifest as a new hash, a status change, or even a 404 (record deleted)
- Receives structured content/metadata (key identifiers and dates)
- Does **NOT** receive plaintext or sensitive personal information
- Provides an immutable, timestamped audit trail—available to the jurisdiction on demand, to document holders/third parties during disputes, or as expert witness testimony in legal proceedings

This provides:
- **Non-repudiation:** Issuer cannot deny issuing the document
- **Timestamp proof:** Document existed at a specific time
- **Regulatory audit:** Jurisdictions can inspect the witness ledger for fraud detection
- **Resilience:** Verification works even if issuer's systems go down

**Public Blockchain (Non-Party)**

Witnessing firms may periodically commit rollups to an inexpensive public blockchain, providing an ultimate immutability guarantee. The blockchain is a "non-party"—infrastructure, not a participant in the transaction. This creates multiple verification paths:

1. **Issuer domain** — Direct check against the issuer
2. **Witnessing firm** — Independent confirmation with timestamp
3. **Public blockchain** — Decentralized trust anchor via rollup inclusion
