## What is Real Estate Agent Verification?

In the real estate industry, the "Showing" is a high-risk event. A buyer (often alone) meets a stranger at a vacant property, or a seller allows a stranger into their home to "preview" it. Criminals often pose as **Real Estate Agents** to gain entry for burglary, assault, or to steal high-value assets during an open house.

The problem is that "Agent ID Cards" are not standardized and are easy to fake. Even a real agent may have had their license suspended for unethical behavior. OCR-to-hash allows a buyer or seller to scan the agent's digital badge or physical ID to verify: **"Is this person a licensed professional in good standing, and are they actually affiliated with the brokerage they claim?"**

## Data Verified

Agent name, license number, state of jurisdiction, brokerage name, photograph (via hash), expiration date, disciplinary status (Clear/Flagged), background check timestamp, NAR (National Association of Realtors) membership status.

**Document Types:**
- **Digital Agent Badge:** Carried on a smartphone app.
- **Physical ID Card:** Worn on a lanyard during showings.
- **Lockbox Access Token:** (Linked hash) proving authorized key access.
- **Listing Agreement:** (Linked hash) proving authority to sell.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`realtor.com`, `zillow.com`, `state-realestate-board.gov`) and the agent's standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Active / Clear** — Agent is currently licensed and authorized for showings.
- **Suspended** — **CRITICAL:** Practice authority is temporarily revoked (e.g., for ethics violations).
- **Expired** — Mandatory license renewal or fees are overdue.
- **Affiliation Change** — **ALERT:** Agent is no longer with the brokerage listed on the card.

## Second-Party Use

The **Real Estate Professional (Agent)** benefits from verification.

**Client Trust:** When meeting a high-net-worth client for the first time, the agent can proactively show their verified hash. "Verified by Realtor.com" provides the client with the professional assurance that the agent is a vetted pro, reducing the "Stranger Danger" friction.

**Lockbox Credibility:** If a neighbor calls the police because they see someone entering a vacant house, the agent can show the verified hash to the responding officer. This provides instant proof of authority and prevents a potential arrest or escalation.

## Third-Party Use

**Home Sellers / Homeowners**
**Showing Vetting:** Before allowing an agent to bring a group of strangers into their home, the seller can scan the agent's badge. Verification ensures the visitor is a tracked professional who can be held accountable if items go missing.

**Property Management Firms**
**Access Control:** Managing thousands of vacant units. OCR-to-hash allows the management system to maintain a cryptographically verified log of every agent who accessed a unit, protecting the firm from "Un-authorized Entry" liability.

**Title and Escrow Companies**
**Commission Verification:** Ensuring that the agent being paid on the settlement statement is the same verified professional who initiated the contract.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Phantom Agent" Fraud Problem**

- **Identity Hijacking:** Scammers using a real agent's name and license number from a public website to create a fake ID badge.
- **Status Hiding:** Continuing to use a "Valid" card after the state board revoked the license for mortgage fraud or theft.
- **Lockbox Phishing:** Using a fake agent ID to trick a homeowner into giving up a keypad code.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**National Real Estate Portals (Realtor.com, Zillow).**
**State Real Estate Commissions.**
**Franchise Portals (RE/MAX, Keller Williams).**

**Privacy Salt:** Critical. Agent schedules and client lists are sensitive. The hash must be salted to prevent "Harvesting" of an agent's active lead list by competitors.

## Rationale

Real estate is a "Trust-Heavy" industry. By turning agent IDs into verifiable digital bridges, we protect the safety of buyers and the security of homes, ensuring that the "Keys to the House" are only held by verified professionals.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing

A jurisdiction may require the issuer to retain a **witnessing firm** for regulatory compliance. The witnessing firm:

- Receives all hashes from the issuer, and any subsequent changes to the payload as they happen—which may manifest as a new hash, a status change, or even a 404 (record deleted)
- Receives structured content/metadata (key identifiers and dates)
- Does **NOT** receive plaintext or sensitive personal information
- Provides an immutable, timestamped audit trail—available to the jurisdiction on demand, to document holders/third parties during disputes, or as expert witness testimony in legal proceedings

This provides:
- **Non-repudiation:** Issuer cannot deny issuing the document
- **Timestamp proof:** Document existed at a specific time
- **Regulatory audit:** Jurisdictions can inspect the witness ledger for fraud detection
- **Resilience:** Verification works even if issuer's systems go down

**Public Blockchain (Non-Party)**

Witnessing firms may periodically commit rollups to an inexpensive public blockchain, providing an ultimate immutability guarantee. The blockchain is a "non-party"—infrastructure, not a participant in the transaction. This creates multiple verification paths:

1. **Issuer domain** — Direct check against the issuer
2. **Witnessing firm** — Independent confirmation with timestamp
3. **Public blockchain** — Decentralized trust anchor via rollup inclusion
