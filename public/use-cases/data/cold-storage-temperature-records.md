## What is a Cold Chain Report?

Many products (like Insulin, Vaccines, or fresh Seafood) must stay at a precise temperature (e.g., between 2°C and 8°C) every second of their journey from the factory to the store. This is called the **Cold Chain**.

A **Compliance Report** is the digital "Receipt" from a sensor that was inside the box. It proves that the refrigerator didn't fail during the 12-hour flight or the 3-day truck ride.

If a shipment hits a "Temperature Spike" (Excursion), the product might be ruined and dangerous. Verified reports prevent carriers from "editing" the data to hide a refrigeration failure.

## Data Verified

Shipment ID, product description, required temperature range, actual Mean Kinetic Temperature (MKT), maximum/minimum temperature recorded, excursion duration (if any), monitoring device ID, download timestamp, compliance status (Compliant/Excursion).

**Document Types:**
- **Compliance Report:** Summary of the full trip's data.
- **Excursion Report:** Detailed analysis of a "Temperature Spike" event.
- **GTP (Good Distribution Practice) Audit:** Annual facility certification.
- **Last-Mile Proof of Delivery:** Proving the cooler was still at 4°C at the hospital door.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (the Logistics Provider or Sensor Vendor) and current record standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Compliant** — Data matches the sensor's official secure cloud log.
- **Excursion Alert** — **ALERT:** Temperature was recorded outside safe limits.
- **Spoiled** — Cargo officially flagged as unsafe for use.
- **Void** — Data retracted due to sensor calibration failure.

## Second-Party Use

The **Freight Forwarder** or **Consignee** benefits from verification.

**Liability Protection:** A forwarder can prove to a high-value customer (e.g., Pfizer) that the cargo remained in-spec during *their* segment of the trip. Verification prevents "blame shifting" between the trucker, the airline, and the warehouse.

**Product Release:** A hospital pharmacist can scan the "Compliant" hash on the shipping box to instantly authorize the release of a $100,000 vaccine batch for use, without waiting for a manual data file review.

## Third-Party Use

**Pharma Quality Assurance (QA)**
**Batch Release:** QA teams at drug manufacturers verify the digital hashes of all "Cold Chain Reports" from their logistics partners to ensure 100% compliance before releasing a lot to the market.

**FDA / EMA Inspectors**
**GDP Audits:** During a "Good Distribution Practice" (GDP) inspection, regulators can scan random archived reports. "Verified by Arctic Logistics" proves the data hasn't been "smoothed" or edited to hide temperature failures.

**Cargo Insurers**
**Claim Settlement:** If a shipment is rejected for "Excursion," the insurer verifies the original sensor data. OCR-to-hash prevents the carrier from deleting the 2-hour window where the refrigerator failed.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Data Smoothing" Fraud Problem**

- **Excursion Deletion:** Editing a PDF report to "delete" a 15-minute window where the temperature hit 25°C (which would spoil the medicine).
- **Sensor Swapping:** Using data from a "Healthy" sensor in a different box to cover up a failure in the actual shipment.
- **Fabricated Reports:** Creating a fake "Compliant" PDF for a truck that didn't have an active cooling unit.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**Logistics Carriers:** (DHL LifeConex, FedEx Custom Critical).
**Sensor Vendors:** (Sensitech, TempTale, Tive - hosting the secure data logs).
**Third-Party Auditors.**

## Jurisdictional Witnessing

A jurisdiction may require the issuer to retain a **witnessing firm** for regulatory compliance. The witnessing firm:

- Receives all hashes from the issuer, and any subsequent changes to the payload as they happen—which may manifest as a new hash, a status change, or even a 404 (record deleted)
- Receives structured content/metadata (key identifiers and dates)
- Does **NOT** receive plaintext or sensitive personal information
- Provides an immutable, timestamped audit trail—available to the jurisdiction on demand, to document holders/third parties during disputes, or as expert witness testimony in legal proceedings

This provides:
- **Non-repudiation:** Issuer cannot deny issuing the document
- **Timestamp proof:** Document existed at a specific time
- **Regulatory audit:** Jurisdictions can inspect the witness ledger for fraud detection
- **Resilience:** Verification works even if issuer's systems go down

**Public Blockchain (Non-Party)**

Witnessing firms may periodically commit rollups to an inexpensive public blockchain, providing an ultimate immutability guarantee. The blockchain is a "non-party"—infrastructure, not a participant in the transaction. This creates multiple verification paths:

1. **Issuer domain** — Direct check against the issuer
2. **Witnessing firm** — Independent confirmation with timestamp
3. **Public blockchain** — Decentralized trust anchor via rollup inclusion


## Competition vs. IoT Dashboards

| Feature | OCR-to-Hash | IoT Cloud (Live Tracking) | Paper Strip Chart |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Bound to the sensor data. | **Platform-Bound.** Trust the IoT vendor. | **Visual.** Trusted only via stamp. |
| **Integrity** | **Cryptographic.** Protects the numbers. | **High.** Direct DB access. | **Zero.** Easily forged. |
| **Interoperability** | **Universal.** PDFs work across all systems. | **Low.** Requires "Integrating" 10 different IoT platforms. | **Universal.** |
| **Retention** | **7-10 Years.** Archival text. | **Ephemeral.** Data often deleted after 12 months. | **Durable.** |

**Why OCR wins here:** The "Audit Gap." While live IoT tracking is great during the trip, 90% of verification happens **after the fact** during audits or claims. OCR-to-hash turns the **Static Report PDF** into an immutable digital anchor that is much more durable and shareable than a "Live Link" to a temporary IoT dashboard.
