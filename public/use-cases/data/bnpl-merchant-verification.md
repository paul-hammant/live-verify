## Data Verified

Merchant legal name, business URL, BNPL provider (Klarna/Affirm/Afterpay), partnership tier, authorization date, last vetting date, allowed products (Pay-in-4, monthly financing).

**Document Types:**
- **Digital Merchant Badge:** (With OCR-to-hash back-link).
- **Certificate of Partnership:** For display in physical stores.
- **Compliance Audit Report:** For BNPL internal records.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`klarna.com`, `affirm.com`) and current merchant standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Verified** — Merchant is in good standing.
- **Suspended** — Merchant under investigation (e.g., for high chargeback rates).
- **Revoked** — Partnership terminated due to fraud or non-compliance.
- **Inactive** — Partnership expired.

## Second-Party Use

The **Merchant** (Store Owner) benefits from verification.

**Consumer Trust:** A small boutique can prove they are a "Verified Partner" of a major bank like Klarna, reducing "Abandoned Carts" caused by customers fearing the site is a scam.

**Banking / Lending:** Proving to other lenders that they have passed the rigorous vetting process of a major BNPL provider, which acts as a "Secondary Credit Signal."

## Third-Party Use

**Consumers (Shoppers)**
**Fraud Prevention:** Before entering a credit card or SSN on a new website, a shopper can scan the "Klarna Verified" badge. If the hash doesn't link back to `klarna.com`, the shopper knows the site is a phishing clone.

**Regulatory Auditors**
**Market Oversight:** Ensuring that BNPL providers are correctly vetting their merchants according to consumer protection laws.

**Cybersecurity Researchers**
**Cloned Site Detection:** Identifying fake e-commerce sites that copy the visual look of real merchants but can't provide a valid verification hash from the BNPL provider.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Fake Store" Fraud Problem**

- **Phishing Sites:** Criminals creating a perfect clone of a real jewelry store, including the "Klarna" logo, to steal customer data and payments.
- **Impersonation:** A merchant whose partnership was revoked for fraud continuing to display the "Verified" badge to lure in victims.
- **Product Misrepresentation:** Claiming to offer "0% APR Financing" when the actual partnership only allows "Pay in 4."

**Issuer Types**

**BNPL Providers:** (Klarna, Affirm, Afterpay, Zip).
**Payment Processors:** (Stripe, Adyen) who manage BNPL integrations.

## Competition vs. Static Badges

| Feature | OCR-to-Hash | Static "Trust" Badge | Verified by Visa (3DS) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Trust** | **Cryptographic.** Bound to the Bank's domain. | **Zero.** Just a JPEG image that anyone can copy. | **High.** But only at the *payment* step. |
| **Verification** | **Pre-Payment.** User verifies *before* giving data. | **None.** | **Late.** Happens after user submits info. |
| **Integrity** | **Binds Merchant.** Hash protects the URL/Name. | **None.** | **High.** |

**Why OCR wins here:** Early Trust. Static "Trust Badges" are the most common tool used by scammers because they are easy to copy. OCR-to-hash turns the badge into a **live cryptographic proof**. It allows the consumer to verify the merchant's legitimacy *before* they start the checkout process, stopping phishing at the source.
