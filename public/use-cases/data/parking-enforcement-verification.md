## What is Parking Enforcement Verification?

In many cities, **Parking Enforcement Officers (PEOs)** have the power to issue significant fines, order vehicle impoundment (towing), and in some jurisdictions, even collect immediate payments for "boot" removal.

This authority is a magnet for fraudsters. Scammers pose as officers to extort "instant cash fines" from tourists, or they place **Fake Parking Tickets** on windshields that lead to phishing websites or fraudulent payment portals.

OCR-to-hash allows a driver to scan an officer's ID badge or the verification line on a physical ticket to confirm: **"Is this a legitimate municipal official, and is this ticket recorded in the city's official ledger?"**

## Data Verified

Officer name, badge ID, department/agency, photograph (via hash), current duty status, jurisdiction boundaries, citation authority level.

**Document Types:**
- **PEO ID Badge:** Worn on the uniform.
- **Physical Citation (Ticket):** Left on the vehicle.
- **Tow Authorization:** Form presented to the vehicle owner at the impound lot.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`sfmta.com`, `nyc.gov`, `london.gov.uk`) and the status.

**Status Indications:**
- **Active Duty** — Officer is currently on shift and authorized to enforce.
- **Verified Citation** — (For tickets) citation exists in the system.
- **Inactive** — Person is not currently authorized.
- **Fraud Alert** — **ALERT:** This ID or ticket number is part of a known scam.

## Second-Party Use

The **Driver / Vehicle Owner** benefits from verification.

**Anti-Extortion:** A "Parking Officer" approaches a tourist and demands $50 in cash to "forget the ticket." The tourist scans the badge and sees **"ACTIVE DUTY - NO CASH PAYMENTS AUTHORIZED."** This provides the user with the proof needed to refuse the scam and call the real police.

**Ticket Authenticity:** A driver finds a ticket on their windshield with a QR code or URL to pay. Before entering credit card info, they scan the verification hash. If it returns **"UNKNOWN"** or **"DOMAIN MISMATCH,"** they know the ticket is a phishing attempt.

**Towing Disputes:** If a car is being hooked to a tow truck, the owner can verify the authorization form presented by the agent to ensure it's a legal municipal order and not a "Predatory Towing" theft.

## Third-Party Use

**Municipal Courts**
**Evidence Admissibility:** Verifying that the officer who issued a contested ticket was actually assigned to that specific beat/zone at the timestamp of the citation.

**Rental Car Agencies**
**Fine Allocation:** Automatically verifying parking tickets returned with rental cars to ensure they are authentic municipal debts before charging the customer's card.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Yellow Paper" Fraud Problem**

- **Phishing Tickets:** Realistic-looking tickets that direct users to `city-fines-pay.com` instead of the real `.gov` site.
- **Impersonation:** Scammers wearing high-viz vests and buying generic "Security" badges to look official.
- **Outdated Authority:** Former employees using an un-returned ID to "work" for themselves by collecting fake fines.

**Issuer Types**

**City Transportation Departments.**
**Private Parking Operators.**
**University Campus Police.**

**Privacy Salt:** Critical. The hash must be salted to prevent "Badge Harvesting" or tracking the movements of individual officers by bad actors.

## Privacy-Preserving Badge Design

Parking enforcement officers issue dozens of citations daily, each a brief, often confrontational interaction. Their badge is visible to every driver who receives a ticket, plus bystanders and dashcams. Full name exposure creates unnecessary privacy and safety risks — parking disputes can escalate, and officers have been targeted for harassment or retaliation.

**Badge shows:** First name + last initial + ID number (e.g., "Robert M 5523")

**Verification returns:** Photo, current duty status, authorized zone, citation authority level

**Why this works:**
- **Driver gets what they need:** Photo match + confirmation officer is on-duty and authorized
- **Officer privacy protected:** Full name not exposed to every frustrated driver who might seek retaliation
- **Accountability preserved:** Municipality maintains full employment records; citation disputes reference the ID number
- **Audit trail intact:** All verifications logged by the department

This differs from police officers, where full name and badge number are typically required for public accountability. Parking enforcement falls between — they have limited authority (civil citations, not arrests) and face disproportionate harassment risk from the high volume of negative interactions.

## Rationale

PEO verification restores "Trust in the Street." By allowing instant, zero-friction verification of municipal authority, it protects vulnerable populations from extortion and ensures that the city's legitimate revenue isn't diverted to criminals.
