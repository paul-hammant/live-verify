## What are Weight Tickets?

In the shipping and bulk commodity industries (e.g., grain, scrap metal, gravel), the **Weight Ticket** is the "Cash Receipt" for the cargo. It records the weight of a truck when full (Gross) and when empty (Tare) to determine the weight of the goods (Net).

Because weight determines the price of multimillion-dollar shipments, these tickets are a primary target for **Weight Fraud**. A dishonest driver might "edit" a 40,000 lb ticket to read 45,000 lbs to over-charge a buyer. Similarly, they might use a "Ghost Ticket" from a non-existent scale to steal cargo. Verified hashes bind the **Gross/Tare Weights, Plate Number, and Timestamp** to the scale operator's domain (e.g., `catscale.com` or `pilotflyingj.com`).

## Data Verified

Ticket number, scale ID, facility location, date/time, vehicle plate/VIN, gross weight, tare weight, net weight, weighmaster name/ID, calibration expiration date.

**Document Types:**
- **Public Weighmaster Ticket:** The primary commercial record.
- **Axle Weight Report:** For DOT axle-load compliance.
- **Scale Calibration Certificate:** (Linked hash) proving the scale is accurate.
- **Automatic Manifest:** For unattended unmanned scales.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`catscale.com`, `pilotj.com`, `loves.com`) and the ticket standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Verified / Certified** — Weight data matches the scale's original digital log.
- **Out of Calibration** — **ALERT:** Scale was overdue for mandatory NIST testing at the time of weighing.
- **Voided** — **ALERT:** Ticket was cancelled (e.g., due to a re-weigh).
- **Plate Mismatch** — **ALERT:** The physical plate on the truck doesn't match the verified hash.

## Second-Party Use

The **Driver** (second party) receives the weight ticket from the scale operator (first party), **keeps it**, and may later hand it to third parties for various reasons, or never do so.

**Personal Record:** The driver has their own verified copy of the weight measurement. Most of the time, the document sits in their truck documentation—the verification value is latent, there *if needed*.

**Peace of Mind:** The driver can confirm at any time that the ticket matches what the scale operator's system recorded and hasn't been altered, ensuring they have accurate documentation of cargo weight.

**Future Optionality:** If a dispute arises—whether about DOT violations, billing disputes, or accident investigations—the driver has cryptographic proof ready without needing to contact the scale operator.

## Third-Party Use

The driver (second party) may hand the verified document to various third parties:

**DOT Inspectors (Roadside Compliance)**
During a roadside inspection for "Overweight" violations, the driver provides the verified hash of their scale ticket. The Trooper can instantly see **"VERIFIED 78,450 LBS"** from a certified scale, proving the truck is legally under the 80,000 lb limit and preventing a $2,000 fine.

**Shippers and Receivers (Billing & Inventory)**
The carrier provides verified weight hashes with their invoices, allowing the shipper's system to perform an instant "Weight Audit." A factory receiving 100 trucks of scrap metal per day can bulk-verify all incoming tickets. If a driver attempts to "pad" a ticket with an extra 5,000 lbs, the system flags the fraud instantly, reducing payment time from 30 days to 24 hours for legitimate tickets.

**State Departments of Agriculture (Weights & Measures)**
Regulators receive verified tickets to confirm that public scales are correctly recording weights and that "Scale Tickets" aren't being fabricated to hide the sale of untaxed commodities.

**Insurance Companies (Accident Forensics)**
In a crash involving a heavy truck, the insurer receives the last verified weight ticket to determine if the vehicle was "overloaded," which can significantly impact liability and stopping-distance calculations.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Phantom Pound" Fraud Problem**

- **Tare Tampering:** Weighing the truck empty with a full fuel tank, but weighing it full with an empty tank to inflate the "Net" weight.
- **PDF Inflation:** Editing a "42,000 lb" net weight to read "48,000 lb" before invoicing the buyer.
- **Facility Spoofing:** Creating a fake ticket from a reputable scale operator to hide the fact that the goods were never weighed.

**Issuer Types (First Party)**

- Certified Public Scales (CAT Scale)
- Privately Owned Industrial Scales
- Port Authority Scales

**Privacy Salt:** Required. License plates and high-value cargo weights are private business data. While each ticket contains unique combinations of ticket numbers, precise timestamps (14:32:01), specific weight measurements (78,450 lb gross, 32,100 lb tare), plate numbers, and scale IDs that provide significant entropy, the commercial sensitivity of this data—and the risk that competitors could use enumeration for "traffic mapping" to track commodity flows and undercut pricing—means salt is essential. Salt protects both driver privacy and shipper competitive intelligence.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing

A jurisdiction may require certified scale operators to retain a **witnessing firm** for regulatory compliance. The witnessing firm:

- Receives all hashes from the scale operator, and any subsequent changes to the ticket as they happen—which may manifest as a new hash, a status change (voided, out of calibration), or even a 404 (record deleted)
- Receives structured content/metadata (gross weights, tare weights, net weights, timestamps, scale IDs, ticket numbers)
- Does **NOT** receive plaintext (vehicle plates, driver names, commodity types, shipper/receiver identities)
- Provides an immutable, timestamped audit trail—available to the jurisdiction on demand, to drivers/third parties during disputes, or as expert witness testimony in legal proceedings

This provides:
- **Non-repudiation:** Scale operator cannot deny issuing the weight measurement
- **Timestamp proof:** Weight ticket existed at a specific time (critical for DOT compliance and billing disputes)
- **Regulatory audit:** Weights & Measures departments can inspect the witness ledger for calibration compliance and fraud prevention
- **Resilience:** Verification works even if scale operator's systems go down or the facility closes

**Public Blockchain (Non-Party)**

Witnessing firms may periodically commit rollups to an inexpensive public blockchain, providing an ultimate immutability guarantee. The blockchain is a "non-party"—infrastructure, not a participant in the transaction. This creates multiple verification paths:

1. **Scale operator domain** — Direct check against the issuer
2. **Witnessing firm** — Independent confirmation with timestamp
3. **Public blockchain** — Decentralized trust anchor via rollup inclusion

## Rationale

Weight is the "Truth of Trade." By turning scale tickets into verifiable digital bridges, we protect the billions of dollars in commerce that rely on accurate measurement and ensure that "What You Pay For" is "What You Get."
