## What are DOT Inspection Reports?

In the commercial trucking industry, the **Annual Vehicle Inspection Report (AVIR)** is the "Health Certificate" for a 40-ton truck. US federal law (FMCSR 396.17) requires every commercial vehicle to pass an annual safety audit of its brakes, tires, lighting, and steering.

These documents are critical for highway safety. Fraud is rampant: shady carriers often "edit" a failed inspection report into a "PASS" to keep a dangerous truck on the road, or they use a fake certificate from a non-existent "Mobile Inspector." Verified hashes bind the **VIN, Inspector License, and Safety Results** to the inspection station's or the state's domain (e.g., `dot.gov` or `jiffy-lube-fleet.com`).

## Data Verified

VIN (Vehicle Identification Number), USDOT number, carrier name, unit number, plate number, inspection date, inspector name/license, facility ID, pass/fail status for 13+ safety categories (Brakes, Steering, etc.), mileage at inspection.

**Document Types:**
- **Annual Inspection Report (AVIR):** The formal 1-page summary.
- **Roadside Inspection (Level I-III):** Performed by police/troopers.
- **Pre-Trip/Post-Trip Log (DVIR):** Daily driver safety records.
- **Out-of-Service Order:** Notice requiring immediate repair.

## Verification Response

The endpoint returns a simple status code:

- **OK** — Vehicle is current and safe for road use
- **OUT_OF_SERVICE** — Vehicle has failed inspection and is legally prohibited from moving; do not dispatch
- **EXPIRED** — Mandatory annual inspection period has passed; schedule inspection immediately
- **CORRECTION_REQUIRED** — Minor defects found; verified proof of repair needed before long-haul
- **404** — Inspection not found (never performed, wrong VIN, or OCR error)

The issuer domain is visible from the `verify:` line on the report itself (e.g., `dot-inspect.com`).

## Post-Verification Actions

None typically. The verification confirms the vehicle passed inspection; that's the value for roadside enforcement, brokers, and shippers.

**Why No Further Action:**

- **Troopers** just need the status code to decide whether to perform a full Level I inspection or wave the truck through
- **Brokers/shippers** just need to confirm the carrier's fleet is compliant before tendering a load
- **Insurers** just need to verify the fleet's safety posture before underwriting

If there's a problem (OUT_OF_SERVICE, EXPIRED), the action is clear: don't move the truck, schedule repairs. No POST form needed.

**For Fraudulent Inspection Stations:**

If a verifier suspects an inspection station is issuing fake passes, the complaint goes to FMCSA or the state DOT — not through a verification endpoint. These are regulatory enforcement matters.

## Second-Party Use

The **Fleet Manager / Owner-Operator** benefits from verification.

**Roadside Enforcement Speed:** During a random DOT stop, the driver shows the verified hash of their annual inspection. The Trooper can instantly see **"VERIFIED PASS - EXPIRES 2027"** on their tablet, potentially skipping a lengthy "Level I" roadside inspection and getting the truck back on the road in minutes.

**Broker Onboarding:** Before a freight broker gives a high-value load to a carrier, they scan the carrier's verified inspection reports. "Verified by Penske" provides the broker with the proof needed to trust the carrier's safety posture without manual spreadsheet checks.

## Third-Party Use

**State Troopers / Roadside Inspectors**
**Rapid Vetting:** Instead of manually typing a 17-digit VIN into a database, the officer scans the dashboard placard hash. Verified hashes eliminate "VIN Typos" and expose "Clone Plates" where a bad truck uses a good truck's paperwork.

**Insurance Underwriters**
**Risk Portfolio Audit:** Verifying that 100% of a trucking fleet has verified, active annual inspections before renewing a multi-million dollar liability policy.

**Shippers (e.g., Amazon, Walmart)**
**Supply Chain Safety:** Automatically rejecting carriers whose trucks have expired or unverified safety certificates, protecting the shipper's brand from "Bad Press" after an accident.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Pass-for-Cash" Fraud Problem**

- **Violation Hiding:** Editing an inspection to remove a "Failed Brake" finding to avoid a $2,000 repair bill.
- **Ghost Inspections:** Creating fake safety stickers for trucks that were never visited by an inspector.
- **VIN Clamping:** Using one good truck's VIN and paperwork for an entire fleet of "junk" trucks.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**Certified Mechanical Shops.**
**Fleet Leasing Companies (Penske, Ryder).**
**State Department of Transportation Portals.**

**Privacy Salt:** Low. Commercial vehicle safety is mostly public record. However, the inspector's individual license number should be salted to protect professional privacy.

## Rationale

Truck safety is a "Life-and-Death" domain. By turning annual reports into verifiable digital bridges, we ensure that the "Chain of Safety" is backed by cryptographic proof, keeping dangerous vehicles off the highway and rewarding safe carriers.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing

A jurisdiction may require the issuer to retain a **witnessing firm** for regulatory compliance. The witnessing firm:

- Receives all hashes from the issuer, and any subsequent changes to the payload as they happen—which may manifest as a new hash, a status change, or even a 404 (record deleted)
- Receives structured content/metadata (key identifiers and dates)
- Does **NOT** receive plaintext or sensitive personal information
- Provides an immutable, timestamped audit trail—available to the jurisdiction on demand, to document holders/third parties during disputes, or as expert witness testimony in legal proceedings

This provides:
- **Non-repudiation:** Issuer cannot deny issuing the document
- **Timestamp proof:** Document existed at a specific time
- **Regulatory audit:** Jurisdictions can inspect the witness ledger for fraud detection
- **Resilience:** Verification works even if issuer's systems go down

**Public Blockchain (Non-Party)**

Witnessing firms may periodically commit rollups to an inexpensive public blockchain, providing an ultimate immutability guarantee. The blockchain is a "non-party"—infrastructure, not a participant in the transaction. This creates multiple verification paths:

1. **Issuer domain** — Direct check against the issuer
2. **Witnessing firm** — Independent confirmation with timestamp
3. **Public blockchain** — Decentralized trust anchor via rollup inclusion

## UK MOT Certificates

The **MOT test** (Ministry of Transport) is the UK's annual roadworthiness inspection for vehicles over 3 years old. It checks brakes, lights, emissions, tyres, and structural integrity.

MOT fraud is a known problem: dodgy garages issue fake passes for vehicles that would fail, or backdate certificates to cover gaps in coverage.

**Note:** DVSA already provides a free MOT history lookup at gov.uk. OCR-to-hash adds value by verifying the physical certificate itself — useful when the paper is presented but internet access is limited (e.g., roadside purchase).

## Data Verified (MOT)

Vehicle registration, VIN, make/model, test date, expiry date, pass/fail result, mileage at test, advisory items, test station ID.

## Verification Response (MOT)

- **OK** — Vehicle has valid MOT; roadworthy
- **FAIL** — Vehicle failed test; not roadworthy
- **EXPIRED** — MOT has lapsed; vehicle cannot legally be driven on public roads (except to a pre-booked test)
- **404** — Certificate not found (wrong reg, OCR error, or fraudulent certificate)

## Second-Party Use (MOT)

**Private Sellers:** Proving to a buyer that the MOT certificate in hand is genuine and matches DVSA records. Stops sellers presenting fake passes for cars that actually failed.

**Used Car Dealers:** Verifying trade-in vehicles have valid MOT before accepting them onto the forecourt.

## Third-Party Use (MOT)

**Used Car Buyers:** Before handing over cash for a private sale, scanning the MOT certificate to confirm it's genuine. Protects against "clocked" cars where mileage on the cert doesn't match the odometer.

**Insurers:** Confirming MOT status when processing claims — some policies are void if the vehicle had no valid MOT at the time of an accident.

## German TÜV (Hauptuntersuchung)

The **TÜV inspection** (Technischer Überwachungsverein) is Germany's biennial vehicle safety and emissions test. The famous TÜV sticker on the rear plate shows the expiry month/year.

## Verification Response (TÜV)

- **OK** — Vehicle passed HU; valid until expiry date
- **MÄNGEL** — Vehicle has defects requiring repair before passing
- **EXPIRED** — HU has lapsed; vehicle may not be driven
- **404** — Report not found

## Other Jurisdictions

The same pattern applies to:

- **Australia:** Roadworthy Certificate (RWC) — required for vehicle sales in most states
- **France:** Contrôle Technique — biennial inspection
- **Netherlands:** APK (Algemene Periodieke Keuring) — annual inspection
- **Japan:** Shaken (車検) — biennial inspection, notoriously thorough
- **US States:** Emissions/safety inspections vary by state (California smog check, Texas safety inspection, etc.)

All follow the same verification model:
- Status code confirms pass/fail/expired
- No post-verification action needed — the status is the value
- Fraudulent stations reported to transport authority, not via verification endpoint
