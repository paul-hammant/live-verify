## What is an Expert Report?

In a lawsuit about a building collapse or a medical error, the judge and jury aren't experts in engineering or surgery. They rely on **Expert Witnesses** to explain what happened.

The **Expert Report** is the formal document where the scientist or doctor writes their professional opinion: "The crane fell because the weld was weak."

In high-stakes trials, lawyers sometimes "Edit" the expert's findings in the final PDF to make the opinion sound stronger for their side. Verified hashes ensure the report the jury sees matches the **expert's original, un-altered scientific findings**.

## Data Verified

Expert name/credentials (PE, MD, Ph.D.), retaining law firm, case caption/number, specific subject of opinion, final damage estimate (numerical), date of report, methodology used (e.g., ASTM standards), page count of full report.

**Document Types:**
- **Expert Report:** Rule 26 compliant formal disclosure.
- **Affidavit of Merit:** Required for medical malpractice filings.
- **Supplemental Report:** For new data discovered pre-trial.
- **Forensic Accounting Summary:** For white-collar crime trials.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (the Expert's Firm or University) and the report standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Final** — Report matches the expert's official file and version.
- **Superseded** — Replaced by a Supplemental Report (critical for attorneys).
- **Withdrawn** — Expert has retracted their opinion (e.g., due to data error).
- **In-Litigation** — Subject to a Daubert challenge or motion to strike.

## Second-Party Use

The **Retaining Attorney** benefits from verification.

**Daubert Defense:** Proving to the judge that the "Expert Report" provided to opposing counsel is the **un-altered official version**. Verification ensures that no junior associate or client has "Self-Edited" the expert's findings to sound more favorable, which would disqualify the expert.

**Settlement Negotiation:** Providing a "Verified Expert Opinion" to an insurance carrier. A verified report from a reputable firm like Roux or Exponent carries much more weight in mediation than an unverified PDF.

## Third-Party Use

**Opposing Counsel**
**Integrity Audit:** Instantly verifying that every page of the 200-page expert report matches the expert's hash. This stops the "Page Swapping" fraud where a party replaces a negative page with a more neutral one during discovery.

**The Courts / Judges**
**Reliability Review:** A judge can scan the hash during a "Motion to Exclude" hearing to confirm the expert's current standing and the report's authenticity.

**Insurance Claims Teams**
**Reserve Accuracy:** Verifying the "Damages Estimate" in the expert report to ensure the legal reserves are set correctly at the home office.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Expert Influence" Fraud Problem**

- **Opinion Laundering:** An attorney editing an expert's "Maybe" into a "Definitely" in the final PDF report.
- **Credential Inflation:** Editing an expert's CV or report header to show "Board Certified" when they actually failed the exam.
- **Draft Leaking:** Presenting an unauthorized early "Draft" as the "Final Report" to trick a party into settling.

**Issuer Types**

**Forensic Engineering Firms:** (Exponent, Roux, Thornton Tomasetti).
**Medical Expert Groups.**
**Forensic Accountants:** (Big 4 Forensic units).
**University Departments:** (Hosting for faculty experts).

## Competition vs. E-Discovery Platforms (Relativity)

| Feature | OCR-to-Hash | E-Discovery (Relativity) | Scanned PDF Report |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Bound to the Expert. | **System-Bound.** Trust the DB admin. | **Zero.** Easily forged. |
| **User Access** | **Universal.** PDFs stay verifiable post-discovery. | **Restricted.** Access usually cut off after the trial ends. | **Universal.** |
| **Integrity** | **Binds Opinion.** Protects every word. | **Data-Only.** Doesn't verify physical printouts. | **Vulnerable.** |
| **Cost** | **Low.** Standard web infra. | **Very High.** Monthly "Seat Fees" and hosting. | **None.** |

**Why OCR wins here:** The "Room Moment." Expert reports are read by judges and juries on paper or flattened tablets. They are used in depositions far from the IT office. OCR-to-hash turns the **Physical Page** into an immutable digital anchor, ensuring that the expert's *actual* opinion is what the jury sees, not a lawyer's "Edited Version."
