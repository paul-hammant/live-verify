## Data Verified

Expert name and credentials, retaining party, case reference, report date, subject matter, opinions and conclusions, methodology used, materials reviewed, compensation disclosure, expert's signature, any amendments or supplemental reports.

**Report Types:**
- **Engineering Reports:** Structural failure, product defect, accident reconstruction
- **Medical Reports:** Injury causation, disability assessment, malpractice opinions
- **Forensic Reports:** Document examination, digital forensics, fingerprints
- **Financial Reports:** Damages calculation, business valuation, fraud analysis
- **Scientific Reports:** Environmental, toxicology, materials analysis
- **Vocational Reports:** Earning capacity, employability assessment

**Multi-Page Considerations:** Expert reports are often lengthy technical documents (50-200+ pages). Per-page verification prevents page substitution, particularly important for opinion sections and damages calculations.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (the expert's firm or individual practice) and the responder text.

**Status Indications:**
- **Verified** - Report matches expert's records
- **Superseded** - Report has been supplemented or amended
- **Withdrawn** - Expert has withdrawn the opinion
- **Preliminary** - Draft report, final version pending
- **Redacted** - Verified, but confidential portions redacted

**Version Tracking:** Verification should indicate report version: "Verified - Version 2, dated [date], supersedes Version 1."

## Second-Party Use (Retaining Party Verifying Their Expert's Report)

## Verification Architecture

**The Expert Report Fraud Problem**

Expert report fraud takes several forms:

- **Fabricated Reports:** Entirely fake reports from non-existent or impersonated experts
- **Altered Opinions:** Genuine reports with modified conclusions or damages figures
- **Credential Fraud:** Reports from individuals lacking claimed credentials
- **Page Substitution:** Replacing key opinion pages in lengthy reports
- **Unauthorized Amendments:** Changes not authorized by the expert
- **Ghost-Written Reports:** Reports prepared by others but signed by "expert"

OCR-to-hash addresses fabrication, alteration, and page substitution. Credential verification requires checking claimed qualifications.

**Experts as Issuers**

Individual experts or their firms issue reports:

**Solo Practitioners:** Individual experts maintain their own records.

**Expert Firms:** Multi-expert consulting firms.

**Academic Experts:** University-affiliated experts.

**Corporate Consultants:** Engineers, accountants in professional firms.

Each expert would maintain verification capability for reports they've issued.

**Credential Verification Integration**

Expert credentials should be verifiable:

**Professional Licenses:** Medical, engineering, CPA licenses.

**Board Certifications:** Specialty certifications.

**Academic Credentials:** Degrees and appointments.

**Professional Memberships:** Society memberships.

Report verification could link to credential verification: "Report verified. Expert credentials verified: [link to license verification]."

**Federal Rule 26 Disclosures**

Federal litigation requires expert disclosures:

**Rule 26(a)(2)(B):** Written report requirements.

**Required Contents:** Opinions, basis, data considered, qualifications, compensation.

**Disclosure Timing:** Deadlines for expert disclosure.

**Rebuttal Reports:** Responding to opposing experts.

Verification supports compliance with disclosure requirements.

**Version Control and Amendments**

Expert reports evolve:

**Preliminary Reports:** Initial opinions before all facts known.

**Supplemental Reports:** Additional opinions based on new information.

**Rebuttal Reports:** Responding to opposing experts.

**Errata:** Corrections to errors in original reports.

**Deposition Amendments:** Changes made during or after deposition.

Each version should be independently verifiable, with clear succession: "This is Version 3, superseding Versions 1 and 2."

**Confidentiality Considerations**

Expert reports often contain sensitive information:

**Privilege Issues:** Reports may be privileged until disclosure.

**Protective Orders:** Reports subject to confidentiality orders.

**Sealed Proceedings:** Reports in sealed cases.

**Medical Privacy:** Health information in medical expert reports.

Verification confirms authenticity without disclosing confidential content.

**Daubert and Reliability**

Expert opinions must meet reliability standards:

**Daubert Factors:** Testability, peer review, error rates, acceptance.

**Methodology Disclosure:** How opinions were reached.

**Data Reliance:** What information the expert considered.

**Qualifications:** Expert's qualifications to opine.

Verification doesn't assess reliability but confirms the report claiming certain methodology is what the expert actually issued.

**Retention and Production**

Expert file requirements:

**Draft Retention:** Some drafts may be discoverable.

**Communication Retention:** Attorney-expert communications.

**Underlying Data:** Data and materials relied upon.

**Production Obligations:** What must be produced in discovery.

Verified final reports distinguish from drafts and work product.

**Cross-Examination Support**

Verification aids cross-examination:

**Prior Opinions:** Verify expert's prior reports in other cases.

**Consistency Check:** Compare opinions across cases.

**Credential Verification:** Confirm claimed qualifications.

**Compensation Disclosure:** Verify compensation claimed in reports.

**Impeachment Material:** Verified prior reports can impeach inconsistent testimony.

**Insurance Claim Context**

Expert reports in insurance claims:

**Causation Opinions:** What caused the loss.

**Damages Assessment:** Repair costs, replacement values.

**Coverage Opinions:** Whether loss is covered.

**Fraud Opinions:** Whether claim is fraudulent.

**Subrogation Reports:** Supporting recovery actions.

High-value claims may have multiple experts on each side—all reports should be verifiable.
