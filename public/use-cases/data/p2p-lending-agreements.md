## What is a P2P Lending Agreement?

**Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Lending** allows individuals or small businesses to borrow money directly from other individuals through platforms like LendingClub or Prosper.

The **Lending Agreement** (or Promissory Note) is the legal contract that says: "Investor Group A lent Person B $10,000 at 8% interest."

**"Loan Padding"** is a common financial fraud where a borrower "edits" a P2P agreement to show a smaller debt than they actually have, or a higher "verified income" stream, to trick a traditional bank into giving them a mortgage. **"Duplicate Financing"** occurs when a borrower uses the same set of un-verified paper documents to take out three different loans from three different platforms at once. OCR-to-hash binds the **Loan ID, Amount, and APR** to the fintech platform's domain.

## Data Verified

Borrower name, Loan ID, Principal amount, Fixed/Variable APR, Monthly payment amount, Loan Term (months), Origination date, Maturity date, Platform ID.

**Document Types:**
- **Promissory Note:** The primary legal contract.
- **Loan Disclosure Statement:** Summarizing fees and TILA (Truth in Lending) math.
- **Payment History Report:** (Linked hash) proving on-time performance.
- **Payoff Letter:** Proving the debt is satisfied.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (the P2P platform) and the current loan standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Current** — Payments are up to date; loan is in good standing.
- **Paid in Full** — Debt is satisfied; note is void.
- **Delinquent** — **ALERT:** Payments are > 30 days overdue.
- **Charged Off** — Loan has defaulted; legal collection in progress.

## Second-Party Use

The **Borrower** (second party) receives the promissory note from the P2P platform (first party), **keeps it**, and may later hand it to third parties for various reasons, or never do so.

**Personal Record:** They have their own verified copy of the loan terms. Most of the time, the document sits in their files—the verification value is latent, there *if needed*.

**Peace of Mind:** They can confirm at any time that the note matches what the platform's system recorded and hasn't been altered.

**Future Optionality:** If a dispute arises about payment terms or if they apply for additional financing, they have cryptographic proof ready without needing to contact the platform.

## Third-Party Use

The borrower (second party) may hand the verified document to various third parties:

**Traditional Banks (Mortgage Lenders)**
**Debt Verification:** Before approving a home loan, the bank scans the P2P agreement. "Verified by LendingClub.com" ensures the borrower hasn't "photoshopped" a $50,000 debt down to $5,000 to hide their true leverage.

**Credit Score Providers (FICO / Vantage)**
**Data Accuracy:** Verifying the granular terms of alternative credit data to ensure the borrower's score accurately reflects their non-bank debt performance.

**Asset-Backed Security (ABS) Investors**
**Portfolio Audit:** Investors buying "bundles" of P2P loans can verify the underlying promissory notes at scale by scanning hashes, ensuring the "Pool" hasn't been corrupted with fake or inflated loans.

## Verification Architecture

**The " FinTech Forgery" Fraud Problem**

- **Balance Deflation:** A borrower editing their P2P dashboard or PDF to hide a large debt from a mortgage underwriter.
- **APR Tampering:** Editing a 25% "Bad Credit" interest rate to look like a 7% "Prime" rate.
- **Phantom Origination:** Creating a fake loan agreement from a real platform to "wash" stolen money or commit identity theft.

**Issuer Types (First Party)**

- P2P Marketplaces (LendingClub, Prosper, Upstart)
- Private Credit Funds
- B2B Lending Platforms (e.g., Funding Circle)

**Privacy Salt:** Required. Unlike documents with many unpredictable variables, P2P lending agreements often contain enumerable values—round dollar amounts ($5k, $10k, $25k), standard APR tiers (6.99%, 8.42%, 12.99%), and common loan terms (36, 60 months). A competitor could feasibly enumerate combinations to reverse-engineer platform lending patterns and borrower risk profiles. Salt protects this sensitive financial intelligence.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing

A jurisdiction may require P2P lending platforms to retain a **witnessing firm** for regulatory compliance. The witnessing firm:

- Receives all hashes from the platform, and any subsequent changes to the payload as they happen—which may manifest as a new hash, a status change (paid in full, delinquent, charged off), or even a 404 (record deleted)
- Receives structured content/metadata (loan IDs, principal amounts, APRs, payment terms, origination dates)
- Does **NOT** receive plaintext (borrower names, SSNs, bank account details)
- Provides an immutable, timestamped audit trail—available to the jurisdiction on demand, to borrowers/third parties during disputes, or as expert witness testimony in legal proceedings

This provides:
- **Non-repudiation:** Platform cannot deny issuing the loan terms
- **Timestamp proof:** Hash existed at a specific time
- **Regulatory audit:** State banking commissions can inspect the witness ledger for predatory lending patterns
- **Resilience:** Verification works even if platform's systems go down or the platform exits the market

**Public Blockchain (Non-Party)**

Witnessing firms may periodically commit rollups to an inexpensive public blockchain, providing an ultimate immutability guarantee. The blockchain is a "non-party"—infrastructure, not a participant in the transaction. This creates multiple verification paths:

1. **Platform domain** — Direct check against the issuer
2. **Witnessing firm** — Independent confirmation with timestamp
3. **Public blockchain** — Decentralized trust anchor via rollup inclusion

## Competition vs. API (Aggregators)

| Feature | OCR-to-Hash | Plaid / Yodlee (API) | Scanned PDF |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Bound to the Platform. | **System-Bound.** Trust the aggregator. | **Zero.** Easily forged. |
| **Privacy** | **High.** Share only the *Summary*. | **Low.** Aggregators often scrape full history. | **High.** |
| **Connectivity** | **Offline-Ready.** Proves the paper. | **None.** Requires live API sync. | **Static.** |
| **Speed** | **Instant.** 5-second scan. | **Slow.** Requires login/MFA. | **Manual.** |

**Why OCR wins here:** The "Loan File" reality. In a mortgage closing, "Paper Artifacts" (PDFs) are still the standard. Lenders don't want to maintain 50 different "Fintech Logins" for every applicant. OCR-to-hash turns the **Static PDF Note** into a live, trusted digital link that carries its own proof of truth into the lender's file.
