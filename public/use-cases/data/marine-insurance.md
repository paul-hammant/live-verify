## Data Verified

Assured name, Loss Payee (Bank), Certificate number, Vessel name, Voyage route (Port-to-Port), cargo description, total amount insured (usually 110% of CIF), coverage clauses (e.g., ICC A), issuing broker/carrier, date of issuance.

**Document Types:**
- **Marine Cargo Certificate:** Issued per shipment under an open policy.
- **Open Cover Summary:** For high-volume exporters.
- **Declaration of Value:** (Linked hash) for specific high-risk loads.
- **Survey Report:** (Linked hash) proving cargo was non-damaged at loading.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`allianz.com`, `zurich.com`, `chubb.com`) and current policy standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Active/In-Force** — Premium paid; cargo is verified covered.
- **Cancelled** — **ALERT:** Coverage terminated (High-risk for banks/sellers).
- **Claim Active** — Incident reported (e.g., General Average or Cargo Loss).
- **Void** — Assigned to wrong vessel or misdeclared.

## Second-Party Use

The **Exporter / Importer (Assured)** benefits from verification.

**Trade Finance (L/C):** Proving to a bank that the $1.25M insurance claim is verified by the source. Banks won't payout on a Letter of Credit without 100% cryptographic certainty that the insurance matches the shipment details. A verified hash prevents the bank from rejecting the certificate due to "Paperwork Inconsistency."

**Payment Assurance:** A buyer in NYC can verify the insurance provided by the Shanghai seller to ensure the goods are fully protected against a "Total Loss at Sea" before wiring the final balance.

## Third-Party Use

**Banks (Lenders / Negotiating Banks)**
**Collateral Protection:** Marine insurance is the only thing protecting the bank's money if the ship sinks. Verification ensures the borrower hasn't "Edited" the PDF to show a $1M limit when they only paid for $100k.

**Ocean Carriers / Ship Lines**
**Liability Handoff:** Verifying that "Shipper-Interest Insurance" is in place for high-value or hazardous cargo, reducing the carrier's exposure to 3rd party claims.

**Customs Authorities**
**Valuation Check:** Verifying the "Insured Value" as a secondary check on the "Commercial Invoice" value to catch tax/duty evasion.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Ghost Policy" Fraud Problem**

- **Fabricated Certificates:** Small, un-vetted brokers creating fake "Lloyd's" certificates for shipments that don't exist, to trick banks into providing "Trade Financing."
- **Limit Inflation:** Editing a $10,000 policy to read $1,000,000 to use as collateral for a fraudulent loan.
- **Exclusion Concealment:** Deleting the clause that excludes "War Risks" or "Strikes" before sending the policy to a bank during a global conflict.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**Global Marine Carriers:** (Allianz, Zurich, Chubb, AXA XL).
**Specialist Brokers:** (Marsh, Aon, Gallagher).
**Lloyd's Syndicates.**

## Jurisdictional Witnessing

A jurisdiction may require the issuer to retain a **witnessing firm** for regulatory compliance. The witnessing firm:

- Receives all hashes from the issuer, and any subsequent changes to the payload as they happen—which may manifest as a new hash, a status change, or even a 404 (record deleted)
- Receives structured content/metadata (key identifiers and dates)
- Does **NOT** receive plaintext or sensitive personal information
- Provides an immutable, timestamped audit trail—available to the jurisdiction on demand, to document holders/third parties during disputes, or as expert witness testimony in legal proceedings

This provides:
- **Non-repudiation:** Issuer cannot deny issuing the document
- **Timestamp proof:** Document existed at a specific time
- **Regulatory audit:** Jurisdictions can inspect the witness ledger for fraud detection
- **Resilience:** Verification works even if issuer's systems go down

**Public Blockchain (Non-Party)**

Witnessing firms may periodically commit rollups to an inexpensive public blockchain, providing an ultimate immutability guarantee. The blockchain is a "non-party"—infrastructure, not a participant in the transaction. This creates multiple verification paths:

1. **Issuer domain** — Direct check against the issuer
2. **Witnessing firm** — Independent confirmation with timestamp
3. **Public blockchain** — Decentralized trust anchor via rollup inclusion


## Competition vs. Blockchain (TradeLens)

| Feature | OCR-to-Hash | Trade Finance Blockchain | Paper / PDF Certificate |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Bound to the Carrier. | **Consensus-Bound.** Trust the network. | **Zero.** Easily forged. |
| **Adoption** | **High.** Works with existing paper/PDF docs. | **Low.** Requires every party to join the same chain. | **Universal.** |
| **Interoperability** | **High.** Verified PDF works for any local bank. | **Siloed.** Hard to verify if you aren't on the chain. | **Universal.** |
| **Integrity** | **Binds Content.** Protects the $ amounts. | **Data-Only.** | **Vulnerable.** |

**Why OCR wins here:** The "Local Bank" reality. A small exporter in Vietnam might use a local bank that has no idea what "TradeLens" or "Corda" is. But the bank **does trust** `allianz.com`. OCR-to-hash turns the **Standard PDF Certificate** into a "Universal Trust Link" that works across every border and every tech-tier.

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

## Data Verified

Vessel name, IMO number (unique 7-digit ID), Flag State, agreed hull value (USD), deductible amount, classification society (e.g., ABS, DNV, LR), primary underwriter ID, effective/expiration dates, trading limit inclusions/exclusions.

**Document Types:**
- **Evidence of Hull Insurance:** Required for port entry and bank compliance.
- **Certificate of Entry:** (Linked hash) for P&I crossover items.
- **Vessel Mortgage Endorsement:** Proving the bank is the "Loss Payee."
- **Condition Survey:** (Linked hash) proving the ship is sea-worthy.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`gard.no`, `skuld.com`, `chubb.com`) and current policy standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **In Force** — Premium paid; vessel is verified covered.
- **Suspended** — **ALERT:** Coverage paused due to class suspension or survey failure.
- **Cancelled** — Policy terminated (Extreme risk for ship-mortgage holders).
- **Lapsed** — Term ended; no renewal found.

## Second-Party Use

The **Shipowner / Operator** benefits from verification.

**Ship Finance:** Proving to a maritime lender (e.g., DNB or Nordea) that the $45M asset is "Verified Insured." Banks won't advance funds for bunker fuel or maintenance without 100% cryptographic certainty that the hull insurance is real and active.

**Port Entry:** Proving to a foreign port authority (e.g., Singapore or Rotterdam) that the vessel has the mandatory hull and pollution-related insurance to enter the harbor.

## Third-Party Use

**Ship-Mortgage Lenders**
**Collateral Protection:** H&M insurance is the only thing protecting the bank's $45M loan if the ship sinks. Verification ensures the owner hasn't "Edited" the PDF to show a $45M value when they actually only insured it for $20M to save on premiums.

**Maritime Lawyers / Arbitrators**
**Evidence Audit:** Instantly verifying the "Trading Limits" of a vessel involved in a casualty. If the ship crashed in an "Excluded Zone," the verified hash provides the definitive proof needed for the coverage dispute.

**Bunker Suppliers**
**Credit Vetting:** Verifying the insurance quality of a vessel before providing $500,000 in fuel on credit terms.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Ghost Ship" Fraud Problem**

- **Value Inflation:** Editing an agreed value from $10M to $50M to trick a bank into giving a larger ship-mortgage.
- **Exclusion Erasure:** Deleting the line that excludes "War Risk Zones" before sailing into a conflict area.
- **Classification Fraud:** Claiming the ship is "In Class" with Lloyd's Register on the paper form when their class has actually been suspended for safety failures.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**Marine Mutuals (Clubs):** (e.g., Gard, Skuld).
**Commercial Marine Carriers:** (Chubb, Swiss Re, Munich Re).
**Lloyd's Syndicates.**

## Jurisdictional Witnessing

A jurisdiction may require the issuer to retain a **witnessing firm** for regulatory compliance. The witnessing firm:

- Receives all hashes from the issuer, and any subsequent changes to the payload as they happen—which may manifest as a new hash, a status change, or even a 404 (record deleted)
- Receives structured content/metadata (key identifiers and dates)
- Does **NOT** receive plaintext or sensitive personal information
- Provides an immutable, timestamped audit trail—available to the jurisdiction on demand, to document holders/third parties during disputes, or as expert witness testimony in legal proceedings

This provides:
- **Non-repudiation:** Issuer cannot deny issuing the document
- **Timestamp proof:** Document existed at a specific time
- **Regulatory audit:** Jurisdictions can inspect the witness ledger for fraud detection
- **Resilience:** Verification works even if issuer's systems go down

**Jurisdictional Requirements (United States)**

The IRS does not mandate or recognize third-party witnessing firms for federal tax documents. The IRS maintains authoritative records within its own systems, and verification occurs via direct query to IRS endpoints.

However:
- **State tax authorities** may have different requirements (e.g., state-level charity registration requires independent witness firms)
- **International stakeholders** (foreign tax authorities, treaty partners) may demand independent verification from witness firms not located in the US
- **FATCA compliance** (Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act) may require US documents to be witnessed by non-US firms when shared across borders

**Public Blockchain (Non-Party)**

Witnessing firms may periodically commit rollups to an inexpensive public blockchain, providing an ultimate immutability guarantee. The blockchain is a "non-party"—infrastructure, not a participant in the transaction. This creates multiple verification paths:

1. **Issuer domain** — Direct check against the issuer
2. **Witnessing firm** — Independent confirmation with timestamp
3. **Public blockchain** — Decentralized trust anchor via rollup inclusion


## Competition vs. Equasis / Vessel Databases

| Feature | OCR-to-Hash | Equasis / IHS Markit (Database) | Scanned PDF Policy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Bound to the Underwriter. | **Data-Bound.** Trust the 3rd party database. | **Zero.** Easily forged. |
| **Integrity** | **Cryptographic.** Binds the *Hull Value*. | **Vague.** Often only shows "Insurer Name." | **None.** |
| **Freshness** | **Real-time.** Shows if premium was paid today. | **Laggy.** Database updates can take 1-2 weeks. | **Static.** |
| **User Access** | **Universal.** Any port or lawyer can verify. | **Restricted.** Some high-tier data is pay-walled. | **Universal.** |

**Why OCR wins here:** The "Bridge" Reality. Decisions about vessel safety and finance happen in busy offices far from the ship. People work with "Closing Folders" (PDFs). OCR-to-hash turns the **Static Policy Declaration** into a live, high-authority digital anchor that is much more important for legal liability than a generic database entry.

## What is a P&I Certificate?

In the world of giant cargo ships, "Normal" insurance isn't enough. Shipowners join a **P&I Club** (Protection & Indemnity)—a group of owners who share the risk of massive disasters like oil spills or ship collisions.

The **Certificate of Entry** is the ship's "Unlimited Credit Card" for liability. It is the only paper that port authorities will accept before allowing a $100 million tanker to dock.

Thieves use "Fake P&I Papers" to sneak dangerous or uninsured ships into ports. Verified hashes allow a harbor master to scan the certificate and see the **verified $1 billion+ coverage** on the Club's official domain in seconds.

**Certificate Variations:** Multiple certificate types or levels may exist.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain and the responder text (e.g., "Valid ID" or "Denied").

**Status Indications:**
- **Valid** - Document verified and current
- **Expired** - Document has reached expiration
- **Revoked** - Document has been revoked or cancelled
- **Superseded** - A newer version exists

The verification response may include additional context such as issue date, expiration date, or document serial numbers.

## Second-Party Use

The document holder (subject/recipient) benefits from verification.

**Authenticity Confirmation:** Verify certificate after receipt to confirm it's genuine.

**Credential Display:** Present verified credentials to employers or clients.

**Professional Development:** Track verified certifications for career advancement.

**Compliance Documentation:** Maintain verified certificates for regulatory requirements.

**Renewal Planning:** Monitor certification status to avoid expiration.

## Third-Party Use

**Insurance Companies**

Underwriting and claims processing:

**Policy Underwriting:** Verify supporting documents during policy issuance.

**Claims Verification:** Validate documentation during claims processing.

**Risk Assessment:** Confirm permits, licenses, and certifications for risk evaluation.

**Fraud Detection:** Identify fraudulent documentation in claims or applications.

**Coverage Disputes:** Reference verified documents in coverage determination.

**Customs and Border Authorities**

International trade compliance:

**Import Clearance:** Verify shipping documents for customs clearance.

**Duty Assessment:** Validate commercial invoices and declarations.

**Trade Compliance:** Confirm certificates of origin and trade documents.

**Security Screening:** Verify cargo documentation for security.

**Export Controls:** Validate export documentation and licenses.

**Freight Forwarders and Carriers**

Logistics and transportation:

**Shipment Acceptance:** Verify documents before accepting cargo.

**Carrier Handoffs:** Validate documentation at transfer points.

**Liability Determination:** Reference verified documents for claims.

**Route Planning:** Confirm documentation for transit requirements.

**Delivery Confirmation:** Verify documents at final delivery.

## Verification Architecture

**The Protection & Indemnity (P&I) club certificates Fraud Problem**

Document fraud creates significant risks:

- **Fabrication:** Entirely fake documents created from scratch
- **Alteration:** Genuine documents with modified content (dates, amounts, names)
- **Impersonation:** Documents falsely claiming to be from legitimate issuers
- **Expired/Revoked Documents:** Presenting invalid documents as current

OCR-to-hash verification addresses fake and altered documents. Domain binding confirms the claimed issuer actually issued the document.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

Who issues these documents and operates verification endpoints?

**Primary Issuers:** Organizations with direct authority to issue these documents.

**Licensed Professionals:** Professionals authorized to create and certify documents.

**Government Agencies:** Federal, state, or local agencies with jurisdiction.

**Industry Bodies:** Trade associations and professional organizations.

**System Integration**

Verification integrates with relevant systems:

**Issuer Systems:** Core operational systems generate verification hashes at document creation.

**Industry Standards:** Existing data standards extended to include verification.

**Regulatory Systems:** Government databases for systematic hash receipt and oversight.

**Third-Party Platforms:** Industry portals and platforms enable verification access.

## Rationale

Prevents fake P&I certificates. Domain binding verifies International Group P&I club. Extremely high limits ($1bn+ pollution/collision liability). Port state control verification. Oil Pollution Act (OPA 90) compliance. Long claims tail.
