## What are Workplace Postings?

Mandatory workplace postings are government-required notices that inform workers of their rights regarding safety, wages, discrimination, and leave. These must be posted in conspicuous locations accessible to all employees, typically employee breakrooms, hallways, or near time clocks.

The problem is that these posters are often outdated or even fraudulent. Employers may fail to update posters when laws change (e.g., minimum wage increases), or shady managers might "edit" a poster to hide certain rights (e.g., changing "12 weeks" of FMLA leave to "4 weeks"). Additionally, private vendors often scam businesses into buying expensive poster bundles that are actually free from the government.

OCR-to-hash allows an employee to scan the poster to verify: **"Is this the current, un-altered official version directly from the issuing authority (e.g., DOL, OSHA, EEOC)?"**

## Key Examples

### Health & Safety (OSHA)
*   **Purpose:** Inform workers of their right to a safe workplace and how to report hazards.
*   **Risk:** Fake posters might omit the right to request an inspection or list an internal HR number instead of the official hotline.

### Wages & Hours (FLSA)
*   **Purpose:** Display current federal/state minimum wage and overtime rules.
*   **Risk:** "Wage theft" via altered posters that misstate the "Tip Credit" or overtime eligibility.

### Employee Rights & Leave (FMLA, PUMP Act)
*   **Purpose:** Detail rights to unpaid, job-protected leave or lactation accommodations.
*   **Risk:** Employers inflating eligibility requirements to discourage leave.

## Verification Architecture

**The Poster Fraud Problem**

- **Outdated Info:** Keeping a 2022 minimum wage poster up in 2026.
- **Selective Deletion:** Removing the section on "Union Rights" from an EEO poster.
- **Compliance Scams:** Forcing businesses to buy "certified" posters that are actually home-printed fakes.

**Issuer Types**

**Federal Agencies (DOL, OSHA, EEOC).**
**State Departments of Labor.**
**Municipal Labor Standards Offices.**

## Rationale

Workplace postings are the "Bill of Rights" for the breakroom. By turning them into verifiable digital bridges, we ensure that employees are informed by the digital truth of the law, not the creative editing of a manager.
