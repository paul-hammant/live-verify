## What is Patient Consent?

Before a doctor can perform surgery or a scientist can use your DNA for a study, you must sign an **Informed Consent Form**. This is the legal proof that you understand the risks and rewards.

In the US, you also sign a **HIPAA Authorization**, which tells the hospital exactly who they are allowed to share your private health data with.

"Consent Fraud" is a dangerous crime: a researcher might edit a "Survey Only" consent form to allow invasive "Genetic Testing" without the patient's knowledge. Verified hashes ensure the **un-altered text** of the agreement is what the patient actually signed.

## Data Verified

**Patient Name**, **Date of Birth**, **Specific Procedure/Treatment/Disclosure Scope**, **Ordering/Treating Physician Name**, **Consent Form Version** and **Date**, **Patient Signature Status** (present/witnessed), **Witness Name** (if applicable), **Any Amendments/Addendums**, **HIPAA Authorization Scope** (e.g., disclosure to specific parties).

**Document Types:**
-   **Informed Consent Forms (ICF):** For medical procedures, surgeries, research participation.
-   **HIPAA Authorization Forms:** For disclosure of Protected Health Information (PHI).
-   **Advance Directives/Living Wills:** Patient end-of-life care wishes.
-   **Assent Forms:** For minors in clinical research.
-   **Release of Medical Records Authorizations:** Specific consent for record transfer.

**Multi-Page Handling:** Many consent forms (especially for complex procedures or clinical trials) are multi-page. Per-page verification prevents page substitution, ensuring the entire agreed-upon terms are intact.

**Privacy Salt:**
**CRITICAL.** These documents contain highly sensitive Protected Health Information (PHI). All verification strings must include a high-entropy **"Consent ID"** or **"Session ID"** (unique to each consent event) as a random salt to prevent enumerating patient consents or guessing specific procedures.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (the healthcare provider, research institution, or ethics board) and the responder text.

**Status Indications:**
-   **Valid** — Consent is current and in effect for the specified procedure/disclosure.
-   **Revoked** — Patient has actively revoked consent (e.g., for future research data use).
-   **Superseded** — A newer version of the consent form has been signed.
-   **Expired** — Consent for a time-limited activity has expired.
-   **Inadmissible** — Document flagged internally for administrative error (e.g., missing witness).

**Version & Scope:** Verification may confirm the consent version and its scope: "Valid - Version 3.0 for Appendectomy, no research authorization."

## Second-Party Use (Patient Verifying Their Own Consent)

Patients benefit from clear, verifiable control over their medical decisions and data.

**Terms Confirmation:** After signing, patients can verify the form accurately reflects what they consented to, preventing misinterpretations or alterations of critical medical decisions.
**Revocation Proof:** If a patient revokes consent (e.g., for participation in a research study), they can verify that the revocation was officially recorded and acknowledged by the institution.
**Dispute Evidence:** In cases of alleged unauthorized treatment or data disclosure, a verified consent form serves as irrefutable evidence of the agreed-upon terms.

## Third-Party Use

**Healthcare Providers (Hospitals, Clinics, Physicians)**
*Legal protection and ethical practice.*

**Pre-Procedure Validation:** Before performing a surgery or high-risk procedure, medical staff can verify the patient's consent form is current and covers the exact procedure, reducing medical malpractice risk.
**HIPAA Compliance:** When disclosing PHI to third parties, providers can verify that the patient's HIPAA authorization form explicitly covers that disclosure.
**Emergency Consent:** In emergency settings, if family presents a consent form, rapid verification can confirm patient wishes (e.g., for blood transfusion refusals) against hospital records.

**Clinical Trial Sponsors & Research Institutions**
*Regulatory compliance and research integrity.*

**Enrollment Due Diligence:** Sponsors verify that research participants provided valid informed consent to the correct protocol version, a fundamental requirement for FDA/EMA submissions.
**Data Use Authorization:** For biobanks or secondary data analysis, researchers verify consent for specific data uses, ensuring ethical and regulatory compliance.
**Audit Readiness:** During FDA/EMA audits, verified consent forms provide an auditable trail of ethical conduct and compliance with GCP (Good Clinical Practice).

**Ethics Boards (IRB/REC - Institutional Review Boards)**
*Oversight and participant protection.*

**Protocol Compliance:** IRBs verify that researchers are using the latest IRB-approved consent forms, preventing the use of outdated versions that might not reflect current risks or participant rights.
**Adverse Event Review:** In the event of serious adverse events in a trial, the IRB can verify the participant's consent documentation to ensure appropriate disclosure was made.

**Legal Professionals (Attorneys)**
*Litigation and patient advocacy.*

**Malpractice Defense/Prosecution:** In medical malpractice cases, attorneys verify consent forms to establish whether a procedure was authorized and risks were properly disclosed.
**Privacy Litigation:** In PHI breach cases, attorneys can verify HIPAA authorizations to determine if data disclosures were unauthorized or exceeded the scope of consent.

## Verification Architecture

**The Patient Consent Fraud Problem**

Patient consent fraud has severe ethical, legal, and medical consequences:
-   **Fabricated Consent:** Creating a fake consent form to justify unauthorized treatment or data use.
-   **Altered Scope:** Modifying a genuine consent form to broaden its scope (e.g., adding "research participation" after signing).
-   **Backdated Consent:** Dating a consent form prior to its actual signing to cover a procedural error.
-   **Version Misrepresentation:** Using an outdated consent form version that doesn't reflect current risks or patient rights.
-   **Unauthorized Disclosure:** Releasing PHI without valid patient authorization.

OCR-to-hash addresses **fabrication, alteration, and version misrepresentation**. Domain binding ensures that a consent form claiming to be from Acme Medical Center verifies against `consent.acmemedical.com`.

**Healthcare Providers & Research Institutions as Issuers**
The healthcare entity where consent is obtained is the natural issuer:
-   **Hospitals/Clinics:** Generate consent forms for treatments.
-   **Research Institutions:** Generate ICFs for clinical trials.
-   **IRBs/Ethics Committees:** May maintain a registry of approved consent form hashes.

**Privacy-Enhancing Features**
-   **Privacy Salt (Consent ID/Session ID):** Crucial for preventing re-identification or enumerating sensitive medical events. The random `Booking Ref` in the snippet acts as this salt.
-   **Minimum Disclosure:** Verification response should confirm authenticity and status without revealing full PHI.

**Integration with EHR/EMR Systems**
-   **EHR/EMR Integration:** Electronic Health Record systems generate and store consent forms. The EHR system would publish the hash for verification.
-   **Digital Signatures:** Many systems use electronic signatures. OCR-to-hash complements these by verifying the *printed output* or *viewable PDF* matches the digitally signed record.

**Regulatory Compliance (HIPAA, 21 CFR Part 11, GCP)**
-   **HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act):** Strict privacy rules for PHI. OCR-to-hash minimizes data transfer.
-   **FDA (21 CFR Part 11):** Requirements for electronic records and electronic signatures in clinical trials. Verifiable paper outputs (e.g., from e-Consent systems) can meet some requirements.
-   **GCP (Good Clinical Practice):** International ethical and scientific quality standard for clinical trials. Valid informed consent is foundational to GCP.

## Rationale

Patient consent forms and HIPAA authorizations are **legally and ethically critical** for protecting patient autonomy and privacy in healthcare. Verification directly combats **consent fraud** and **unauthorized PHI disclosure** by providing instant, tamper-evident proof that the patient's agreement was obtained for a specific procedure or data use. Domain binding ensures legitimacy, enhancing patient trust and reducing legal liability for healthcare providers.
