## Common Display Requirements

## Verification Value

**Problem:** Safety certificate fraud:
- Expired certificates with altered dates
- Fake inspection stickers to avoid maintenance costs
- Forged inspector signatures
- Counterfeit certificates after failed inspections

**Solution:** Building occupants, tenants, and inspectors can verify certificates are genuine. Critical for elevator safety - passengers can verify the cab certificate before riding.
