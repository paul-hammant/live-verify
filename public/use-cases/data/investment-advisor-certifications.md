## Data Verified

Representative name, photo (hash), Individual CRD number, Firm CRD number, registration status (Registered/Suspended/Barred), jurisdictions of authority, ADV Part 2B (Brochure Supplement) status, date of last filing, disciplinary disclosure flag.

**Document Types:**
- **IAR Credential Card:** Carried by the advisor.
- **ADV Part 2B Extract:** The mandatory "Advisor Biography" disclosure.
- **SEC Registration Certificate:** For the RIA firm's office.
- **Client Service Agreement:** (Linked hash) for legal onboarding.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`sec.gov`, `finra.org`) and current regulatory standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Registered** — Representative is authorized to provide investment advice for a fee.
- **Barred** — **ALERT:** Permanently prohibited from the industry.
- **Suspended** — Temporarily restricted (dates and reasons verified).
- **Inactive** — No longer affiliated with a registered firm.

## Second-Party Use

The **Investment Advisor (IAR)** benefits from verification.

**Trust Building:** Proving to a potential high-net-worth client that they are a "Verified Fiduciary" and not an unlicensed "Guru" or a "Barred Broker." The client can scan the badge during an initial meeting to see the "Active" status directly from the SEC domain.

**Institutional Onboarding:** Proving to a major custodian bank (e.g., Schwab or Fidelity) that their individual credentials are verified and current, speeding up the "Trading Authority" setup.

## Third-Party Use

**Retail Investors (Consumers)**
**Fraud Prevention:** Before handing over life savings, an investor can verify the advisor's credentials. This stops "Affinity Fraud" where scammers pose as legitimate advisors to target specific religious or professional communities.

**Compliance Departments (CCOs)**
**Oversight:** Ensuring that every advisor in a large firm is actually keeping their filings current. OCR-to-hash allows for **automated credential auditing** across thousands of employees.

**Referral Platforms**
**Merchant Vetting:** Ensuring that only verified, non-barred advisors are being recommended to users on financial lead-gen platforms.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Fake Fiduciary" Fraud Problem**

- **Ghost Credentials:** A barred advisor using their old, unexpired "SEC Registration" wall certificate to lure in victims.
- **ADV Falsification:** Editing the mandatory "ADV Brochure" to remove mention of a prior felony conviction or a regulatory fine.
- **Identity Swapping:** Using a real person's CRD number but editing the photo on the "Representative Card."

**Issuer Types**

**U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).**
**FINRA:** (Managing the IAPD database).
**State Securities Regulators.**

**Privacy Salt:** Critical. CRD numbers and names are public, but the hash must be salted to prevent "Mass Scraping" of the advisor database by marketers or scammers.

## Competition vs. SEC Advisor Search (IAPD)

| Feature | OCR-to-Hash | IAPD / BrokerCheck (Web) | Scanned PDF Brochure |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Bound to `sec.gov`. | **Database.** Direct from source. | **Zero.** Easily forged. |
| **Integrity** | **Binds Identity.** Proves *Who* is at the desk. | **Vague.** Hard to prove the person in front of you is the person in the DB. | **None.** |
| **Speed** | **Instant.** 5-second scan. | **Slow.** Requires typing names/CRDs and navigating Gov UI. | **N/A.** |
| **Hardware** | **Universal.** Any smartphone camera. | **Technical.** Requires laptop/dedicated search. | **Visual.** |

**Why OCR wins here:** The "Meeting Moment." Trust is established in the first 5 minutes of a meeting. Clients are often too polite to type a person's ID into a government website while they are sitting there. OCR-to-hash turns the **Advisor's Business Card** or **Wall Certificate** into a live, high-speed trust anchor, making "Fiduciary Duty" a verified fact in seconds.
