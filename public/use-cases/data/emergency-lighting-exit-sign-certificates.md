## What is an Emergency Light Certificate?

If the power fails during a fire, the "Exit" signs and the battery-powered floodlights in the stairwells are the only things that prevent a panic.

By law, every building must test these batteries for **90 minutes** every year. The **Inspection Certificate** is the proof that the building didn't just "check the bulbs," but actually verified the batteries can last long enough for a full evacuation.

"Pencil Whipping" is common: inspectors sometimes sign off on a "Pass" without ever actually running the 90-minute test. Verified hashes allow fire marshals to identify shady inspection firms that fabricate safety data.

## Data Verified

Building name/address, specific zone/wing, total fixture count (Emergency vs Exit), battery discharge test duration (e.g., 90 min), bulb/LED status, inspector name/license, date of inspection, expiration date.

**Document Types:**
- **Annual Inspection Certificate:** Required for occupancy permits.
- **Monthly Functional Test Log:** The technical checklist for staff.
- **Battery Replacement Record:** Proving recent hardware maintenance.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (the Fire Safety Firm) and current compliance standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Compliant** — Annual 90-minute load test passed and verified.
- **Deficiency Noted** — **ALERT:** One or more fixtures failed; repair required within 30 days.
- **Expired** — Mandatory annual inspection interval has passed.
- **Void** — Certificate retracted due to inspector disciplinary action.

## Second-Party Use

The **Building Owner / Hotel Manager** benefits from verification.

**Occupancy Compliance:** Proving to the City Building Department that the facility meets the Life Safety Code (NFPA 101) during a business license renewal. A verified certificate prevents "Clerical Delays" caused by manual paperwork review.

**Liability Defense:** If a power outage occurs and someone falls in a dark stairwell, the owner has an immutable, verified digital record proving that the emergency lighting was tested and passed just weeks prior.

## Third-Party Use

**Fire Marshals**
**Field Adjudication:** During a routine fire walk-through, the marshal scans the hash on the certificate in the lobby. "Verified by Fire Protection Services" ensures the paper isn't a "Fake Pass" created to hide dead batteries.

**Insurance Loss Control**
**Risk Underwriting:** Verifying life safety systems before writing high-value property or liability policies for hotels, malls, and hospitals.

**Health & Safety Officers (OSHA)**
**Workplace Safety:** Ensuring that factory or warehouse exit paths are verified illuminated for employee protection.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Pencil Whipping" Fraud Problem**

- **Fake Load Tests:** Inspectors signing off on a "90-minute pass" when they only spent 5 minutes in the building and never actually cut the power to test batteries.
- **Fixture Count Swapping:** Using a valid certificate from a small store to cover a large, dangerous warehouse.
- **Date Forgery:** Altering an old 2024 certificate to read 2026 to avoid the $1,000 cost of a professional inspection.

**Issuer Types**

**Fire Safety Firms:** (Specializing in suppression and lighting).
**Building Engineering Depts:** (For large corporate campuses).
**Municipal Fire Depts:** (Hosting the official clearance hashes).

## Competition vs. Physical Tags (Cardboard)

| Feature | OCR-to-Hash | Cardboard Hang-Tag | Scanned PDF |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Bound to the Inspector. | **Low.** Easily filled out by anyone with a sharpie. | **Zero.** Easily forged. |
| **Integrity** | **Binds Data.** Protects the fixture counts. | **None.** Data can be scrubbed. | **Vulnerable.** |
| **Hardware** | **Universal.** Any smartphone. | **N/A.** Just looking. | **Visual.** |
| **Audit-ability** | **Digital.** Can be audited remotely. | **Manual.** Requires physical presence. | **Manual.** |

**Why OCR wins here:** The "Emergency Stairwell" reality. Cardboard tags get dusty, torn, and unreadable in the back-of-house areas of a building. OCR-to-hash turns that **Persistent Paper Record** into a live, trusted digital link, ensuring that "Life Safety" data is as durable as the building itself.
