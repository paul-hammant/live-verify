## Verification Architecture

**The Private hire/taxi driver verification cards (female safety) Fraud Problem**

Document fraud creates significant risks:

- **Fabrication:** Entirely fake documents created from scratch
- **Alteration:** Genuine documents with modified content (dates, amounts, names)

- **Income Inflation:** Inflating income or assets on financial documents
- **Photoshop Fraud:** Digital manipulation of statements and documents
- **Shell Company Documents:** Documents from fake or shell entities

OCR-to-hash verification addresses fake and altered documents. Domain binding confirms the claimed issuer actually issued the document.

**Investment Firms:** Brokerage and investment management firms.

**Insurance Companies:** Insurers for policy and claims documents.

Verification integrates with relevant systems:

**Issuer Systems:** Core operational systems generate verification hashes at document creation.

**Industry Standards:** Existing data standards extended to include verification.

**Regulatory Systems:** Government databases for systematic hash receipt and oversight.

**Third-Party Platforms:** Industry portals and platforms enable verification access.
