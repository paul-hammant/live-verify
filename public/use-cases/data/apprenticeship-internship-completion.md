## What is an Apprenticeship Certificate?

In trades like plumbing, electrical, or software engineering, you don't just go to school; you complete thousands of hours of on-the-job training.

The **Certificate of Completion** is the proof that you finished those hours. For a plumber, it's the "Journeyman" card that lets them work without a supervisor. For a software intern, it's the proof that they actually did real work at a major company.

Because these lead directly to high-paying jobs, "internship fraud" (faking a certificate from Google or a local union) is a major problem for recruiters.

## Data Verified

Intern/Apprentice name, sponsor organization, specific program name (e.g., "Journeyman Electrician"), start/end dates, total hours completed, supervisor name, issuing date.

**Document Types:**
- **Internship Completion Certificate:** For students/graduates.
- **Journeyman Card:** For skilled trades (Electrical, Plumbing, HVAC).
- **Certificate of Apprenticeship:** Formal government-recognized program.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (the Company or Union) and current status.

**Status Indications:**
- **Completed** — Program successfully finished.
- **In-Progress** — Currently enrolled (shows hours to date).
- **Withdrawn** — Did not finish the program.
- **Revoked** — Certificate pulled due to disciplinary issues.

## Second-Party Use

The **Intern** or **Apprentice** benefits from verification.

**Job Hunting:** Proving to a future employer that they didn't just "hang out" at a famous company for a summer, but actually completed a structured 480-hour program with a verified CTO.

**College Credit:** Submitting verified proof of internship hours to their university to receive academic credit.

**Trade Licensing:** Using verified hours to qualify for a state professional license (e.g., a Master Plumber license requires verified apprenticeship hours).

## Third-Party Use

**Hiring Managers / Recruiters**
**Resume De-risking:** Internship fraud is common. Scanning the certificate hash instantly confirms the candidate actually worked those dates and wasn't just a friend of someone at the company.

**State Licensing Boards**
**Verification of Experience:** Boards can instantly verify that the hours claimed on a license application match the sponsor's official records, preventing "ghost hours."

**University Registrars**
**Credit Validation:** Ensuring that the "summer internship" submitted for credit was a legitimate, completed program.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Fake Internship" Fraud Problem**

- **Impostor Companies:** Websites that pretend to be real companies and provide fake "completion letters" for a fee.
- **Inflated Scope:** Changing a "Marketing Intern" certificate to read "Senior Product Intern" to get a better job.
- **Date Stretching:** Altering a 4-week internship to appear as a 12-week program.

**Issuer Types**

**Corporations:** (Google, Goldman Sachs, local businesses).
**Trade Unions:** (IBEW, UA, Teamsters).
**Government Depts:** (Department of Labor Apprenticeship office).

## Competition vs. LinkedIn / Background Checks

| Feature | OCR-to-Hash | LinkedIn | Background Check (Checkr/Hireright) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Trust** | **Cryptographic.** Bound to company domain. | **Social.** Self-reported; zero verification for internships. | **High.** But slow and expensive. |
| **Speed** | **Instant.** Scan and see "Verified by tech-dynamic.com." | **N/A.** Just looking at a profile. | **Slow.** Takes 3-7 days to call the company. |
| **Portability** | **High.** Certificate works in any country/language. | **High.** Global platform. | **Low.** Tied to a specific employer request. |

**Why OCR wins here:** Recruitment is about speed and trust. A recruiter can verify a candidate's "Unicorn Startup" internship *during* the initial phone screen by scanning their PDF/paper certificate, bypassing the 5-day delay and $50 cost of a formal background check.
