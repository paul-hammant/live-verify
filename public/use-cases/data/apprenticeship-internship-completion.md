## Verification Architecture

**The Apprenticeship and internship completion Fraud Problem**

Document fraud creates significant risks:

- **Fabrication:** Entirely fake documents created from scratch
- **Alteration:** Genuine documents with modified content (dates, amounts, names)
- **Impersonation:** Documents falsely claiming to be from legitimate issuers
- **Expired/Revoked Documents:** Presenting invalid documents as current
- **Diploma Mills:** Fake credentials from non-accredited institutions
- **Grade Alteration:** Modified transcripts with inflated grades
- **Degree Fabrication:** Completely fabricated degrees from real institutions

OCR-to-hash verification addresses fake and altered documents. Domain binding confirms the claimed issuer actually issued the document.

**Issuer Types**

Who issues these documents and operates verification endpoints?

**Universities and Colleges:** Accredited degree-granting institutions.

**Registrars:** Academic records offices at educational institutions.

**Accreditation Bodies:** Regional and professional accreditors.

**Testing Organizations:** Standardized testing and certification providers.

**System Integration**

Verification integrates with relevant systems:

**Issuer Systems:** Core operational systems generate verification hashes at document creation.

**Industry Standards:** Existing data standards extended to include verification.

**Regulatory Systems:** Government databases for systematic hash receipt and oversight.

**Third-Party Platforms:** Industry portals and platforms enable verification access.
