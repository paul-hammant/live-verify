## What is a Home Inspection?

Before you buy a house, you hire an expert to do a "Physical Exam" of the building. The result is a **Home Inspection Report**.

It lists every defect—from a leaky faucet to a cracked foundation. This report is the "Truth Document" used to negotiate the final price of the house.

Fraud is high-stakes here: sellers or dishonest agents sometimes "Delete" the scary pages (like the ones about mold or foundation failure) before sending the PDF to the buyer's bank. Verified hashes protect the **inspector's actual findings**, ensuring the buyer knows exactly what they are moving into.

## Data Verified

Property address, inspection date, client name, inspector name/license, summary of "Major Deficiencies," structural integrity status, roof age estimate, electrical panel status, total report page count, report ID.

**Document Types:**
- **Home Inspection Report:** The primary 50+ page document.
- **Summary Report:** 2-page extract of just the "Safety/Major" items.
- **WDO (Termite) Report:** (Linked hash) for wood-destroying organisms.
- **Radon / Mold Analysis:** Verified lab results linked to the inspection.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (the Inspection Firm) and the report status.

**Status Indications:**
- **Final** — Report is verified and matches the inspector's ledger.
- **Amended** — A revised report has been issued (e.g., after seller repairs).
- **Stale** — **ALERT:** Report is > 90 days old; property condition may have changed.
- **Void** — Report retracted due to technical error or liability dispute.

## Second-Party Use

The **Home Buyer (Client)** benefits from verification.

**Repair Negotiations:** Proving to a skeptic seller or their agent that the "Structural Issue" isn't a fabricated claim. A verified hash from the inspector's domain makes it impossible for the seller to claim the buyer's lawyer "Edited the PDF" to get a price reduction.

**Insurance Vetting:** Providing a verified condition report to a homeowners insurer to prove the roof is in good condition, securing a lower premium.

## Third-Party Use

**Property Sellers**
**Counter-Offer Integrity:** Instantly verifying the "Major Defects" list provided by the buyer. OCR-to-hash ensures the buyer hasn't "Inserted" new defects into the summary that the inspector never actually found.

**Mortgage Lenders**
**Collateral Protection:** Verifying the "Structural Status" of a high-value property before funding. Lenders can verify the summary hash to ensure the asset isn't a "Teardown" being misrepresented as "Move-in Ready."

**Future Buyers**
**Historical Condition:** In a subsequent sale 3 years later, the new buyer can verify the previous inspection to see what repairs were recommended and confirm if they were actually performed.

## Verification Architecture

**The "PDF Smoothing" Fraud Problem**

- **Defect Deletion:** A seller (or dishonest agent) deleting the "Foundation Repair" page from a PDF report before sending it to a buyer or lender.
- **Photo Tampering:** Replacing a photo of a rusted water heater with a stock photo of a new one.
- **Inspector Impersonation:** Creating a fake report on the letterhead of a reputable firm like Exponent or Pillar to Post.

**Issuer Types**

**National Franchises:** (Pillar to Post, HomeTeam, AmeriSpec).
**Independent PEs / Architects.**
**Reporting Platforms:** (e.g., Spectora, HomeGauge - hosting the hashes).

## Competition vs. Home Inspection Software Portals

| Feature | OCR-to-Hash | Reporting Portal (Spectora) | Scanned PDF |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **User Control** | **High.** Buyer shares only the *Summary*. | **Low.** Portal access often reveals the full 80-page file. | **High.** |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Bound to the Inspector. | **System-Bound.** Trust the portal vendor. | **Zero.** Easily forged. |
| **Persistence** | **High.** Text remains verifiable for 10 years. | **Low.** Access often expires after 12 months. | **Vulnerable.** |
| **Speed** | **Instant.** 5-second scan. | **Slow.** Requires login and navigation. | **N/A.** |

**Why OCR wins here:** The "Data Room" reality. In a fast-moving real estate deal, lawyers and banks work with "Static Artifacts" (PDFs). They don't want to log into 5 different portals for 5 different inspectors. OCR-to-hash turns the **Static PDF** into a portable, cryptographically trusted asset that carries its own proof of truth into the closing file.
