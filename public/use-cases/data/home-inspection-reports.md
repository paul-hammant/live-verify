# Home Inspection Reports

**Category:** Real Estate & Property
**Volume:** Small
**Retention:** 5-10 years (transaction records, liability protection)

## Data Verified

Inspector name and license number, buyer name, seller name (if disclosed), property address, inspection date, report date, property type, systems and components inspected, findings and deficiencies, recommendations, limitations, inspector's signature.

**Report Components:**
- **Structural Systems:** Foundation, framing, roof structure
- **Exterior:** Siding, trim, driveways, grading
- **Roofing:** Covering, flashings, drainage

**Multi-Page Considerations:** Home inspection reports are typically 30-80 pages with photos. Per-page verification prevents page substitution—particularly important for pages documenting major defects.

**Status Indications:**
- **Verified** - Report matches inspector's records

## Verification Architecture

**The Inspection Report Fraud Problem**

Fraudulent inspection reports harm buyers:

- **Fabricated Clean Reports:** Fake reports hiding serious defects
- **Altered Findings:** Genuine reports with defects removed or minimized
- **Inspector Impersonation:** Reports falsely attributed to licensed inspectors
- **Page Substitution:** Replacing defect pages in multi-page reports
- **Photo Manipulation:** Altering or substituting inspection photos
- **Date Fraud:** Old inspections presented as current

OCR-to-hash addresses fabrication and alteration. Inspector license verification confirms credentials.

**Home Inspectors as Issuers**

Licensed inspectors issue reports:

**Independent Inspectors:** Solo practitioners or small firms.

**Inspection Companies:** Multi-inspector companies.

**Specialty Inspectors:** Chimney, pool, septic specialists.

**Engineering Firms:** For structural concerns beyond standard inspection.

Each inspector or firm maintains verification endpoints for reports they issue.

**Licensing and Credentials**

Inspector qualifications vary by state:

**State Licensing:** Most states require inspector licensing.

**Certification Bodies:** ASHI, InterNACHI certifications.

**Insurance Requirements:** E&O insurance requirements.

**Continuing Education:** Ongoing training requirements.

Verification could link to license status: "Inspector licensed in [state], license current."

**Standards of Practice**

Inspection scope defined by standards:

**ASHI Standards:** American Society of Home Inspectors.

**InterNACHI SOP:** International Association of Certified Home Inspectors.

**State Requirements:** Some states specify inspection scope.

**Limitations:** What inspectors are not required to inspect.

Verification confirms the report follows applicable standards.

**Specialty Inspections**

Beyond general home inspection:

**Termite/WDO Inspection:** Wood-destroying organism reports (separate license).

**Radon Testing:** Air and water radon measurements.

**Mold Inspection:** Mold identification and testing.

**Sewer Scope:** Video inspection of sewer lines.

**Pool/Spa Inspection:** Pool and spa systems.

**Chimney Inspection:** CSIA-certified chimney inspection.

Each specialty inspection may require separate verification.

**Report Timing in Transactions**

Inspections have time constraints:

**Inspection Contingency:** Typically 7-14 days from contract.

**Re-Inspection:** After repairs, before closing.

**Pre-Listing Inspection:** Seller's inspection before listing.

**Final Walkthrough:** Not a formal inspection but verifies condition.

Verification timestamp confirms when inspection occurred relative to transaction.

**Defect Classification**

Reports categorize findings:

**Safety Hazards:** Immediate safety concerns.

**Major Defects:** Significant functional or structural issues.

**Minor Defects:** Maintenance items and minor repairs.

**Cosmetic Issues:** Appearance items, typically not negotiated.

**Deferred Maintenance:** Wear items needing future attention.

Verification may summarize: "Verified - 1 safety hazard, 2 major defects identified."

**Photo Documentation**

Modern reports include extensive photos:

**Defect Photos:** Visual documentation of findings.

**System Photos:** Condition of major systems.

**Access Photos:** Documentation of accessible vs. inaccessible areas.

**Labeling:** Photos annotated with findings.

Per-page verification covers photo pages, preventing photo substitution.

**Inspector Liability**

Legal considerations:

**Limitation of Liability:** Most contracts limit inspector liability.

**Statute of Limitations:** Time limits for claims against inspectors.

**E&O Insurance:** Professional liability coverage.

**Standard of Care:** What "reasonable" inspector would find.

Verified reports document exactly what the inspector reported, protecting both inspector and client.

**International Equivalents**

Other countries have similar inspections:

**UK:** Home Buyer Report, Building Survey (RICS).

**Canada:** Provincial licensing, similar scope to US.

**Australia:** Building and Pest Inspections.

**New Zealand:** Pre-Purchase Building Inspections.

Verification architecture can accommodate international variations in format and standards.
