## What is a Sanctions Screening Confirmation?

Before doing business with someone — opening an account, processing a payment, entering a contract — firms must check they're not on a sanctions list. The **screening confirmation** documents that this check was performed, when, against which lists, and the result.

If you do business with a sanctioned party, even accidentally, the penalties are severe (fines, criminal prosecution, reputational destruction). The screening confirmation proves you did your due diligence.

## Data Verified

**Screened party name**, **screening timestamp**, **reference number**, **lists checked** (with versions), **result** (no match / potential match / confirmed match), **screening provider**, **compliance officer sign-off**.

## Data Visible After Verification

**Status Indications:**
- **Clear** — No matches at time of screening
- **Potential Match** — Review required (false positive evaluation)
- **Confirmed Match** — Party is on sanctions list (do not proceed)
- **Expired** — Screening too old, re-screening required
- **Superseded** — Party re-screened with updated result

## Why Continuous Screening Matters

Sanctions lists change constantly. Someone cleared today might be sanctioned tomorrow. Firms must:
- Screen at onboarding
- Re-screen periodically (daily for payments, quarterly for dormant relationships)
- Re-screen when lists update

A confirmation is a **point-in-time snapshot**. It proves you checked — but doesn't guarantee the party is still clear.

## Jurisdiction Differences

| Jurisdiction | Regulator | Primary Lists | Penalties |
|--------------|-----------|---------------|-----------|
| **US** | OFAC (Treasury) | SDN, Sectoral Sanctions, CAPTA | Up to $1M per violation, criminal prosecution |
| **UK** | HMT, OFSI | UK Sanctions List, consolidated list | Unlimited fines, criminal liability |
| **EU** | European Commission | EU Consolidated List | National enforcement varies |
| **UN** | Security Council | UN Sanctions Lists | Member states must implement |

US OFAC applies extraterritorially — even non-US firms processing USD transactions must comply.

## Third-Party Use

**Correspondent banks** — Before processing payments through your institution
**Auditors** — Testing AML/sanctions program effectiveness
**Regulators** — Examinations, enforcement investigations
**Counterparties** — Due diligence before entering contracts
**Insurers** — Trade credit, political risk (sanctions compliance warranties)

## Verification Architecture

**The Problem:**
- Firms claim they screened when they didn't
- Screening results are backdated after problems emerge
- Fabricated confirmations to satisfy audit requirements
- Disputes about what lists were checked and when

**The Fix:** Screening confirmation hashed at time of screening, with timestamp and list versions. Auditor or regulator can verify: this exact screening occurred at this exact time against these exact list versions. Can't be fabricated after the fact.

**Rescreening visibility:** When a party is re-screened, previous confirmations remain valid but show "Superseded" — the audit trail is preserved. If a re-screening reveals a match, the timeline is clear.

## The False Positive Problem

Most "matches" are false positives — common names, similar spellings. The confirmation should document:
- Initial match result
- Review performed (who, when, rationale)
- Final determination (true match vs. false positive)

This review documentation is also verifiable — proving the firm didn't just ignore potential matches.


## Jurisdictional Witnessing

A jurisdiction may require the issuer to retain a **witnessing firm** for regulatory compliance. The witnessing firm:

- Receives all hashes from the issuer, and any subsequent changes to the payload as they happen—which may manifest as a new hash, a status change, or even a 404 (record deleted)
- Receives structured content/metadata (key identifiers and dates)
- Does **NOT** receive plaintext or sensitive personal information
- Provides an immutable, timestamped audit trail—available to the jurisdiction on demand, to document holders/third parties during disputes, or as expert witness testimony in legal proceedings

This provides:
- **Non-repudiation:** Issuer cannot deny issuing the document
- **Timestamp proof:** Document existed at a specific time
- **Regulatory audit:** Jurisdictions can inspect the witness ledger for fraud detection
- **Resilience:** Verification works even if issuer's systems go down

**Public Blockchain (Non-Party)**

Witnessing firms may periodically commit rollups to an inexpensive public blockchain, providing an ultimate immutability guarantee. The blockchain is a "non-party"—infrastructure, not a participant in the transaction. This creates multiple verification paths:

1. **Issuer domain** — Direct check against the issuer
2. **Witnessing firm** — Independent confirmation with timestamp
3. **Public blockchain** — Decentralized trust anchor via rollup inclusion
