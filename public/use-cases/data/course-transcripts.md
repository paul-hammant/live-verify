## What is an Academic Transcript?

An **Academic Transcript** is the "Final Gradebook" of your education. It lists every class you took and exactly what grade you earned.

You need this "Official" paper to apply for Grad School or to prove to an employer that you actually have the skills listed on your resume.

"Transcript Padding" is a common fraud: people often edit a "C" to an "A" or add a "Computer Science" class they never actually took. Verified hashes allow an employer or university to scan the PDF and see the **un-altered grades** directly from the Registrar's database.

## Data Verified

Student name, student ID, specific course codes/titles, individual grades (A-F), credit hours per course, cumulative GPA, degree program, enrollment dates, date of transcript issuance.

**Document Types:**
- **Official Transcript:** Comprehensive history of all terms.
- **Transcript Extract:** Verified proof of specific grades for a job/transfer.
- **Dean's List / Honors Letter:** Proving academic excellence.
- **Transfer Credit Report:** Proving credits from a previous institution.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`ox.ac.uk`, `harvard.edu`) and current record status.

**Status Indications:**
- **Verified** — Content matches the official university database.
- **Amended** — Grade change processed; this version is outdated.
- **Subject to Investigation** — Transcript flagged for potential academic integrity issues.
- **Invalid** — Student ID or course data mismatch.

## Second-Party Use

The **Student / Alumnus** (second party) receives the transcript from the university (first party), **keeps it**, and may later hand it to third parties for various reasons, or never do so.

**Personal Record:** They have their own verified copy of their academic record. Most of the time, the transcript sits in their files—the verification value is latent, there *if needed*.

**Peace of Mind:** They can confirm at any time that it matches what the Registrar's system recorded and hasn't been altered.

**Future Optionality:** If a dispute arises about grades, transfer credits, or degree requirements, they have cryptographic proof ready without needing to contact the university.

## Third-Party Use

The student (second party) may hand the verified document to various third parties:

**Graduate School Admissions**
**Instant Evaluation:** Admissions officers can instantly verify the grades of international applicants by scanning their PDF transcripts, bypassing the expensive and slow "Third-Party Evaluation" services (e.g., WES).

**Employers (HR Departments)**
**GPA Verification:** Ensuring that a candidate hasn't "Rounded Up" their 2.9 GPA to a 3.5 on their resume. A verified transcript provides the "Source of Truth."

**Professional Licensing Boards**
**Prerequisite Proof:** Verifying that a candidate has taken the mandatory courses required for a professional license (e.g., the CPA exam or Medical Board).

## Verification Architecture

**The "Transcript Padding" Fraud Problem**

- **Grade Alteration:** Changing a "C" to an "A" in a PDF editor to get into a top-tier grad school.
- **Ghost Courses:** Adding non-existent courses to a transcript to meet job requirements.
- **Fictitious Degrees:** Creating a fake transcript from a real, famous university for a person who never attended.

**Issuer Types (First Party)**

- University Registrars (The primary authority)
- National Student Clearinghouse (Centralized US record hub)
- Digital Credential Platforms (e.g., Parchment, Digitary)

**Privacy Salt:** Required. Academic records are highly private (FERPA in the USA). Unlike documents with many unpredictable variables, transcripts combine student ID numbers, course codes, and specific grades that could theoretically be enumerated. More critically, the hash must be salted to prevent "Guess-and-Check" searches for individual student grades—a significant privacy violation that could enable unauthorized academic background checks.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing

A jurisdiction may require universities to retain a **witnessing firm** for regulatory compliance. The witnessing firm:

- Receives all hashes from the university, and any subsequent changes to the transcript as they happen—which may manifest as a new hash, a status change (grade amendment), or even a 404 (record deleted)
- Receives structured content/metadata (course codes, credit hours, degree programs, graduation dates)
- Does **NOT** receive plaintext (student names, social security numbers, detailed grade histories)
- Provides an immutable, timestamped audit trail—available to the jurisdiction on demand, to students/third parties during disputes, or as expert witness testimony in legal proceedings

This provides:
- **Non-repudiation:** University cannot deny issuing the transcript or grades
- **Timestamp proof:** Transcript hash existed at a specific time (critical for degree conferral disputes)
- **Regulatory audit:** Department of Education can inspect the witness ledger for FERPA compliance
- **Resilience:** Verification works even if university's systems go down or the institution closes

**Public Blockchain (Non-Party)**

Witnessing firms may periodically commit rollups to an inexpensive public blockchain, providing an ultimate immutability guarantee. The blockchain is a "non-party"—infrastructure, not a participant in the transaction. This creates multiple verification paths:

1. **University domain** — Direct check against the Registrar
2. **Witnessing firm** — Independent confirmation with timestamp
3. **Public blockchain** — Decentralized trust anchor via rollup inclusion

## Competition vs. Official Electronic Delivery (Parchment)

| Feature | OCR-to-Hash | Electronic Delivery (Parchment) | Scanned PDF / Paper |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **User Control** | **High.** Student chooses what to share and how. | **Low.** Locked into the vendor's secure portal. | **High.** |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Bound to the University. | **System-Bound.** Trust the vendor platform. | **Zero.** Easily forged. |
| **Speed** | **Instant.** Scan the paper/PDF. | **Slow.** Often takes 24-48 hours to "Process." | **Instant.** |
| **Cost** | **Low.** Standard web infra. | **Medium.** Fees of $10-$20 per transcript are common. | **None.** |

**Why OCR wins here:** The "Hiring Manager" reality. Recruiters want to verify a candidate *now*, during the interview. They don't want to wait 2 days for an "Official Parchment Link" to be emailed to them. OCR-to-hash turns the **Candidate's PDF** into a live, trusted record that can be verified in seconds.
