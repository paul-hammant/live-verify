## Data Verified

Property owner, environmental consultant name and credentials, site address and legal description, assessment type (Phase I or Phase II), assessment date, contamination findings or "no recognized environmental conditions" statement, recommendations, limitations and data gaps, consultant's signature.

**Assessment Types:**
- **Phase I ESA:** Desktop review, site inspection, interviews—no sampling
- **Phase II ESA:** Subsurface investigation, sampling, laboratory analysis
- **Transaction Screens:** Limited Phase I for lower-risk properties
- **Phase III ESA:** Remediation design and implementation
- **Vapor Intrusion Assessments:** Indoor air quality concerns
- **Asbestos/Lead Paint Surveys:** Building material assessments

**Multi-Page Considerations:** ESA reports are substantial documents (50-200+ pages for Phase II). Per-page verification prevents page substitution attacks—particularly critical when contamination findings might be removed or altered to show a "clean" property.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (the environmental consulting firm) and the responder text.

**Status Indications:**
- **Verified** - This report matches the consultant's records
- **Superseded** - A newer assessment has been completed
- **Limited Scope** - Verification notes scope limitations
- **Withdrawn** - Report has been withdrawn (errors discovered)

**Findings Summary:** Verification may indicate high-level findings: "Verified - Phase I ESA - No RECs identified" or "Verified - Phase II ESA - Contamination identified, see report."

## Second-Party Use (Property Owner Verifying Their Own Assessment)

Property owners benefit from verification.

**Report Authenticity:** After receiving ESA from consultant, verify it's genuine and complete.

**Transaction Preparation:** Before listing property for sale, verify ESA is current.

**Lender Requirements:** Verify ESA meets lender requirements before closing.

**Regulatory Submissions:** Verify reports before submitting to environmental agencies.

**Liability Documentation:** Maintain verified ESA to document due diligence.

## Third-Party Use

**Prospective Buyers**

Transaction due diligence:

**Pre-Purchase Verification:** Verify seller-provided ESA is genuine and unaltered.

**Phase I Review:** Verify "no RECs" findings before proceeding without Phase II.

**Contamination Disclosure:** Verify contamination findings match what seller represented.

**All Appropriate Inquiry:** Verify ESA meets AAI standard for CERCLA protection.

**Lenders**

Commercial lending:

**Loan Underwriting:** Verify ESA before approving commercial real estate loans.

**SBA Loans:** SBA requires Phase I ESA for many commercial loans.

**Collateral Protection:** Verify property isn't contaminated before taking as collateral.

**Portfolio Review:** Periodic verification of ESAs in commercial loan portfolio.

**CMBS Due Diligence:** Verify ESAs for commercial mortgage-backed securities.

**Title Insurance Companies**

Coverage decisions:

**Environmental Endorsements:** Verify ESA before issuing environmental endorsements.

**Claim Prevention:** Verify ESAs to avoid claims from undisclosed contamination.

**Policy Exceptions:** Determine necessary exceptions based on ESA findings.

**Regulatory Agencies**

Environmental oversight:

**Brownfield Programs:** Verify ESAs submitted to state brownfield programs.

**CERCLA Liability:** Verify innocent landowner defense documentation.

**Closure Reports:** Verify cleanup completion reports.

**Voluntary Cleanup Programs:** Verify ESAs in VCP applications.

**Insurance Companies**

Environmental coverage:

**Pollution Liability:** Verify ESAs before issuing environmental insurance.

**Claims Investigation:** Verify ESAs during pollution claims.

**Historical Review:** Verify past ESAs when investigating long-tail claims.

**Real Estate Attorneys**

Transaction support:

**Due Diligence Review:** Verify ESAs provided to clients.

**Contract Conditions:** Verify ESA satisfies contract contingencies.

**Opinion Letters:** Base liability opinions on verified ESAs.

**Litigation Support:** Verify ESAs in contamination disputes.

## Verification Architecture

**The ESA Fraud Problem**

Fraudulent environmental assessments cause significant harm:

- **Fabricated Clean Reports:** Fake Phase I reports showing no RECs on contaminated sites
- **Altered Findings:** Genuine reports with contamination findings removed
- **Page Substitution:** Replacing contamination pages in lengthy reports
- **Scope Fraud:** Reports appearing to be Phase II but lacking actual sampling
- **Consultant Impersonation:** Reports attributed to reputable firms but not authored by them
- **Date Manipulation:** Old assessments presented as current

OCR-to-hash addresses fabrication, alteration, and page substitution. Consultant credential verification confirms the firm actually conducted the assessment.

**Environmental Consultants as Issuers**

Qualified environmental professionals issue ESAs:

**National Firms:** ERM, Tetra Tech, Stantec, Ramboll.

**Regional Consultants:** Mid-size environmental consulting firms.

**Boutique Specialists:** Firms specializing in specific contamination types.

**Licensed Site Professionals:** In states with LSP programs (Massachusetts).

Each firm operates verification endpoints for reports they issue.

**ASTM Standards Compliance**

ESAs follow ASTM standards:

**E1527-21:** Current Phase I standard.

**E1903-19:** Phase II standard.

**E1528-22:** Transaction screen standard.

**E2247-16:** Vapor encroachment screening.

**E2600-15:** Vapor intrusion screening.

Verification could indicate: "Verified - Prepared in accordance with ASTM E1527-21."

**Environmental Professional Qualifications**

Who can sign ESAs:

**PE or PG License:** Professional Engineer or Geologist.

**Relevant Experience:** Specified years of environmental experience.

**State-Specific Requirements:** Some states have additional requirements.

**Continuing Education:** Ongoing training requirements.

Verification confirms the signing professional meets qualifications.

**Recognized Environmental Conditions**

Key ESA terminology:

**REC:** Recognized Environmental Condition—likely contamination.

**CREC:** Controlled REC—contamination with controls in place.

**HREC:** Historical REC—past contamination now remediated.

**De Minimis:** Minor condition not rising to REC level.

**Data Gap:** Information that couldn't be obtained.

Verification may summarize findings: "Verified - 2 RECs identified, see Section 5."

**All Appropriate Inquiry**

CERCLA landowner liability protection:

**AAI Rule:** 40 CFR Part 312 establishes inquiry standards.

**180-Day Currency:** Phase I must be completed within 180 days of acquisition.

**Update Requirements:** Interviews and government record searches must be more current.

**Bona Fide Prospective Purchaser:** AAI is prerequisite for BFP defense.

Verification timestamp proves the ESA was current at time of transaction.

**Chain of Liability Concerns**

Environmental liability follows property:

**Joint and Several Liability:** Any PRP can be liable for entire cleanup.

**Successor Liability:** Buyers can inherit seller's liability.

**Lender Liability:** Secured creditors risk if they "participate in management."

**Due Diligence Defense:** AAI-compliant ESA provides potential liability shield.

Verified ESAs document the due diligence that protects against CERCLA liability.

**Phase II Sampling and Analysis**

When Phase I identifies concerns:

**Soil Sampling:** Subsurface contamination investigation.

**Groundwater Sampling:** Aquifer contamination assessment.

**Laboratory Analysis:** EPA-approved methods for contaminants.

**Risk Assessment:** Comparison to regulatory standards.

**Delineation:** Defining extent of contamination.

Phase II reports require careful verification—sampling results directly affect remediation costs.

**Vapor Intrusion**

Indoor air pathway:

**VI Screening:** Evaluating vapor intrusion potential.

**Indoor Air Sampling:** Actual indoor air quality testing.

**Sub-Slab Sampling:** Vapor beneath building slabs.

**Mitigation Systems:** Vapor barriers and venting systems.

Vapor intrusion assessments are increasingly required components of ESAs.

**Report Updates and Reliance Letters**

ESAs age and may need updating:

**Update Reports:** Refreshing search components of older Phase I.

**Reliance Letters:** Allowing third parties to rely on existing ESA.

**Re-Sampling:** New Phase II sampling if conditions may have changed.

**Material Change:** New information requiring reassessment.

Verification should indicate original date and any updates: "Verified - Original 2022, Updated 2024."
