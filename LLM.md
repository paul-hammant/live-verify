# LLM Context: OCR-to-Hash Verification System

## Project Overview

Proof-of-concept implementations demonstrating **Text-to-Hash** verification (often called **OCR-to-hash**) for resolving fraud or disputes. The pipeline is `Input -> normalization -> hash -> GET`.

### Permutations:
- **OCR Path:** Camera or image clip -> OCR -> normalized-text -> hash -> GET.
- **Selection Path:** Selected digital text -> normalization -> hash -> GET.

### Integration Vision
These capabilities are designed for building into camera apps, browsers (mobile/desktop), email clients, PDF viewers, messaging systems (SMS, WhatsApp, iMessage), and collaboration tools (Slack, Discord).

### POC 1: Camera-Based Document Verification
`public/camera-app/index.html` — Point camera at physical document, OCR extracts text, normalizes, hashes, verifies against issuer's endpoint.

### POC 2: In-Page Text Selection Verification
`public/text-selection-verify.js` — Select text on webpage, right-click "Verify?", computes hash, checks issuer endpoint.

### Additional Modes
See [VERIFICATION-MODES.md](./VERIFICATION-MODES.md) for detailed permutations and the platform integration roadmap.

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. No Backend Server Required
- **Initial approach**: Built with Express backend + in-memory hash database
- **Final approach**: Pure client-side verification against URLs printed on documents
- **Why**: Can deploy to GitHub Pages for free, works offline, no infrastructure needed

### 2. URL-Based Verification (Not Local Database)
The document itself contains:
- Certification text within black square registration marks
- Verification base URL printed below the text (e.g., `verify:paul-hammant.github.io/live-verify/c`)

The app:
1. Uses **OpenCV.js** to detect the black square registration marks
2. Crops to the rectangle defined by the marks
3. Tries **multi-orientation OCR** (0°, 90°, 270°, 180°) and picks the best result
4. Extracts the base URL from the last line of OCR text (accepts `verify:` or `https://` prefix)
5. Removes URL line from certification text
6. Normalizes remaining text (Unicode normalization + whitespace rules)
7. Computes SHA-256 hash
8. **Builds full verification URL** by converting `verify:` to `https://` and appending the hash
9. Fetches the URL and verifies HTTP 200 + "OK" in response
10. Shows green "VERIFIED" or red "FAILS VERIFICATION" overlay on camera

### 3. No Hardcoded Hashes in the App
- We do **NOT** maintain a local database of valid hashes in the app
- Trust model: The organization that controls the domain (e.g., `paul-hammant.github.io`) is trusted
- Hash database is pre-built and deployed to GitHub Pages at `/c/{hash}/index.html`
- If hash matches URL AND endpoint returns 200 + "OK" → verified
- If hash doesn't match URL OR endpoint fails → verification fails

## Use Cases Content

~450 use case documents in `public/use-cases/data/*.md`. Each has YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
title: "Document Title"
category: "Category Name"
type: "use-case"  # or "rollup" for aggregates
slug: "document-slug"
volume: "Medium"
retention: "7 years"
---
```

**Key files:**
- `public/use-cases/data/criteria-template.md` — Template + guidance for writing use cases. Covers: good use case criteria, party definitions (issuer/second/third), fraud patterns, status indications, common objections.
- `scripts/migrate-use-cases.js` — Regenerates `public/use-cases/data/index.json` from .md frontmatter. Run after adding/editing use cases.
- `public/use-cases/view.html` — Client-side markdown viewer. Access via `view.html?doc=slug-name`.

**Workflow:** Edit .md files → run `node scripts/migrate-use-cases.js` → index.json updated.

**Important:** Always run `node scripts/migrate-use-cases.js` before committing changes to use-cases. The generated `index.json` must be kept in sync with the .md files.

**Categories:** 40 categories. Large ones split (Insurance→Specialty/Claims/Bonds, Logistics→Shipping/Customs/Warehouse/Fleet, Banking→Payments/Compliance/Trade/Fintech).

## Core Logic

### Text Normalization Rules (NORMALIZATION.md)

**Step 1: Unicode Character Normalization**
```javascript
// Normalize Unicode characters that OCR might produce
text = text.replace(/[“”„]/g, '"');  // Curly double quotes → straight
text = text.replace(/[‘’]/g, "'");        // Curly single quotes → straight
text = text.replace(/[«»]/g, '"');        // Angle quotes → straight double
text = text.replace(/[–—]/g, '-');        // En/em dash → hyphen
text = text.replace(/\u00A0/g, ' ');                // Non-breaking space → space
text = text.replace(/\u2026/g, '...');              // Ellipsis → three periods
```

**Step 2: Line-by-Line Normalization**
```javascript
const lines = text.split('\n');
const normalizedLines = lines.map(line => {
    line = line.replace(/^\s+/, '');    // Remove leading spaces
    line = line.replace(/\s+$/, '');    // Remove trailing spaces
    line = line.replace(/\s+/g, ' ');   // Collapse multiple spaces
    return line;
})
.filter(line => line.length > 0);       // REMOVE blank lines
```

**Step 3: Final Assembly**
```javascript
return normalizedLines.join('\n');      // No trailing newline
```

### SHA-256 Hashing

**Input Encoding:** UTF-8
**Output Encoding:** Hex (lowercase)
**HMAC:** No (plain SHA-256)

**Browser implementation:**
```javascript
async function sha256(text) {
    const encoder = new TextEncoder();              // UTF-8 encoding
    const data = encoder.encode(text);
    const hashBuffer = await crypto.subtle.digest('SHA-256', data);
    const hashArray = Array.from(new Uint8Array(hashBuffer));
    const hashHex = hashArray.map(b => b.toString(16).padStart(2, '0')).join('');
    return hashHex;                                 // lowercase hex
}
```

**Node.js implementation (for tests):**
```javascript
function sha256(text) {
    const crypto = require('crypto');
    return crypto.createHash('sha256').update(text, 'utf8').digest('hex');
}
```

### Computer Vision: Registration Mark Detection

Uses **OpenCV.js** to detect black square registration marks:

1. Convert image to grayscale
2. Apply Gaussian blur
3. Adaptive thresholding
4. Find contours
5. Filter for square-like shapes (aspect ratio ~1.0, area > threshold)
6. Select best 4 squares that form a rectangle
7. Apply perspective transform to crop and deskew

**Key files:**
- `public/cv/geometry.js` - Geometry utilities (orderCorners, etc.)
- `public/cv/detectSquares.js` - Detection algorithm

### Multi-Orientation OCR

Since users may hold the camera sideways, the app tries OCR at multiple orientations:

```javascript
const orientations = [
    { rotation: 0, canvas: cropped },                // Most likely (portrait)
    { rotation: 270, canvas: rotateCanvas(cropped, 270) },  // Landscape right
    { rotation: 90, canvas: rotateCanvas(cropped, 90) },    // Landscape left
    { rotation: 180, canvas: rotateCanvas(cropped, 180) }   // Upside down (rare)
];

// Try in order: 0°, 270°, 90°, 180°
// Pick FIRST orientation that achieves high confidence (early exit optimization)
for (const { rotation, canvas } of orientations) {
    const result = await Tesseract.recognize(canvas.toDataURL(), 'eng');
    const confidence = result.data.confidence || 0;

    if (confidence > HIGH_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD) {
        // Good enough - use this orientation
        bestResult = result;
        bestRotation = rotation;
        break;
    }
}
```

### High-Resolution Capture

Uses **ImageCapture API** when available for higher resolution than video frames:

```javascript
if ('ImageCapture' in window) {
    const ic = new ImageCapture(track);
    const photo = await ic.takePhoto();           // Returns high-res Blob
    imageBitmap = await createImageBitmap(photo);
}
```

Falls back to canvas capture from video element if ImageCapture not supported.

### Verification Logic

**Verification URL schemes: `verify:` and `vfy:`**

Documents should print base URLs using either the long `verify:` scheme or the short `vfy:` alias instead of `https://`:
- Example (long): `verify:paul-hammant.github.io/live-verify/c`
- Example (short): `vfy:paul-hammant.github.io/live-verify/c`

The app converts either form to `https://` and appends the computed hash:
- `verify:example.com/c` → `https://example.com/c/{hash}`
- `vfy:example.com/c` → `https://example.com/c/{hash}`

This keeps printed documents concise while remaining explicit that the URL is for verification.

**Document-Specific Normalization (`.verification-meta.json`):**

Issuers can optionally provide document-specific normalization rules and OCR optimization hints at the base URL by hosting a `.verification-meta.json` file:

```json
{
  "description": "Example .verification-meta.json for hotel receipts with Swiss Franc formatting",
  "charNormalization": "éèêë→e àáâä→a ìíîï→i òóôö→o ùúûü→u ñ→n ç→c",
  "ocrNormalizationRules": [
    {
      "pattern": "CHF\s+(\d)",
      "replacement": "CHF$1",
      "description": "Remove space between CHF currency code and amount"
    }
  ],
  "tesseract": {
    "lang": "eng",
    "psm": 6,
    "oem": 1,
    "tessedit_char_whitelist": "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0-9 .,-/:()",
    "preserve_interword_spaces": "1"
  }
}
```

If the app finds this file at `https://example.com/c/.verification-meta.json`, it applies the rules in this order:

**1. Text Normalization Rules (applied before standard normalization):**
- `charNormalization`: Compact notation for character mappings (e.g., `éèêë→e` means é→e, è→e, ê→e, ë→e)
  - Use cases: Diacritic removal, known OCR misreads
  - Example: Swiss hotel receipts where `Chéasspätzli` should normalize to `Cheasspatzli`
- `ocrNormalizationRules`: Regex-based structural cleanup (applied after character normalization)
  - Use cases: Whitespace from HTML rendering, date formatting artifacts
  - Example: `CHF\s+(\d)` → `CHF$1` removes spaces between currency code and amount

**2. OCR Optimization (optional Tesseract settings):**
- `lang`: OCR language model (e.g., "eng", "eng+fra")
- `psm`: Page segmentation mode (6 = uniform block of text)
- `oem`: OCR engine mode (1 = LSTM neural net only)
- `tessedit_char_whitelist`: Allowed characters (reduces false positives)
- `preserve_interword_spaces`: Keeps spaces between words intact

**3. Data Retention & Compliance Rules (optional but recommended):**

Issuers can specify legal/regulatory requirements for how verification apps must handle captured data:

```json
{
  "compliance": {
    "dataRetention": {
      "capturedImage": "DELETE_IMMEDIATELY",
      "ocrText": "DELETE_AFTER_VERIFICATION",

Don't enable progressive guidance unless you have a specific reason."

This is particularly useful for:
- Documents with diacritics or special characters that need consistent normalization
- Receipt formats with known whitespace issues (e.g., HTML tabs rendering as spaces)
- Specialized documents with known character sets (e.g., employment letters won't have `@#$%^&*`)
- High-security credentials (healthcare, law enforcement, government IDs) requiring strict compliance
- Multi-jurisdictional deployments needing GDPR, HIPAA, CCPA compliance

**Full verification requires these checks:**

```javascript
// Extract base URL (verify: or https://)
const { url: baseUrl, urlLineIndex } = extractVerificationUrl(rawText);

// Build full URL with hash
const fullVerificationUrl = buildVerificationUrl(baseUrl, hash);
// If baseUrl = "verify:example.com/c", result = "https://example.com/c/{hash}"
// If baseUrl = "https://example.com/c", result = "https://example.com/c/{hash}"

async function verifyAgainstClaimedUrl(claimedUrl, computedHash) {
    // Check 1: Hash in URL
    if (!hashMatchesUrl(claimedUrl, computedHash)) {
        showOverlay('red', 'FAILS VERIFICATION');
        return;
    }

    // Check 2 & 3: Fetch URL and verify response
    const response = await fetch(claimedUrl);

    if (response.status !== 200) {
        showOverlay('red', 'FAILS VERIFICATION');
        return;
    }

    const body = await response.text();
    if (!body.includes('OK')) {
        // Show actual status (e.g., "REVOKED")
        const status = body.trim().toUpperCase().substring(0, 50);
        showOverlay('red', status);
        return;
    }

    // All checks passed
    showOverlay('green', 'VERIFIED');
}
```

## Training Pages

Three fictional Unseen University certificates (Terry Pratchett universe) for testing:

1. **Bachelor of Thaumatology** - Ponder Stibbons
   - Hash: `1cddfbb2adfa13e4562d274b59e56b946f174a0feb566622dd67a4880cf0b223`

2. **Master of Applied Anthropics** - Esk Weatherwax
   - Hash: `6725b845dcdf2490adf8d5f62e09e5f2055cb80c6200e5ccf58875c8190f4a80`

3. **Doctorate in High Energy Magic** - Adrian Turnipseed
   - Hash: `09d1e6765c2dbd833e5a1f4770d9f0c9368224f7b1aed34de7a3bd5bf4d1f031`

All have corresponding verification endpoints at `/c/{hash}/index.html`

## Dependencies

### Runtime (Loaded from CDN)
- **Tesseract.js v5**: OCR engine (~2MB WASM)
- **OpenCV.js 4.x**: Computer vision for registration mark detection (~8MB)
- **Web Crypto API**: Built into browsers for SHA-256

### Development (npm install)
- **Jest 29**: Testing framework
- **@playwright/test**: E2E testing
- **jsdom**: DOM environment for Jest
- **jest-environment-jsdom**: jsdom integration for Jest

### NOT Used
- ~~Express/CORS~~ (no server needed)
- ~~better-sqlite3~~ (no database needed)

## Build Process

### Generate Hash Database

```bash
node build-hashes.js
```

Creates:
- `public/hashes.json` - Metadata for all hashes
- `public/c/{hash}/index.html` - Verification endpoints
- Updates build timestamp in `public/live-verify-app.js`

### Generate Training Pages

```bash
node generate-training-pages.js
```

Creates HTML pages for the three training certificates.

## Deployment

### GitHub Pages (Current)
1. Push to GitHub
2. GitHub Actions runs tests
3. Deploys `public/` folder to `https://paul-hammant.github.io/live-verify/`

### Local Testing
```bash
cd public
python3 -m http.server 8000
# Visit http://localhost:8000
```

**Note:** HTTPS required for camera access. Use GitHub Pages or ngrok for mobile testing.

## CORS Considerations

The app performs a **full fetch** of verification URLs:
- If CORS allows: Fetches and checks for HTTP 200 + "OK" in body
- If CORS blocks: Shows "CANNOT VERIFY - Network error or CORS restriction"

Most verification endpoints need CORS headers:
```
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
```

GitHub Pages provides this automatically.

## UI/UX Features

### Camera Controls
- Enable Camera → Stop Camera
- Floating shutter button (center of viewfinder)
- Resolution fallback: 4K → 1080p → 720p

### Result Display (Tabbed Interface)
1. **Captured Image** - Cropped & oriented image with "Copy Image" button
2. **Extracted Text** - Raw OCR output
3. **Normalized Text** - After normalization rules applied

### Status Indicators
- 📷 Ready to scan
- ✅ Camera active
- 📸 Capturing...
- 🧭 Detecting registration square...
- 🔄 Detecting text orientation...
- 🔧 Normalizing text...
- 🔐 Generating hash...
- 🌐 Verifying against claimed URL...
- ✅ VERIFIED / ❌ FAILS VERIFICATION

### Easter Egg
Click the app title to see build timestamp.

## Known Limitations

1. **OCR accuracy**: Tesseract isn't perfect, may need retries
2. **Registration marks**: Must be visible and form a clear rectangle
3. **Lighting**: Poor lighting affects both detection and OCR quality
4. **Camera quality**: Works best with modern phone cameras
5. **HTTPS required**: Camera API needs HTTPS (GitHub Pages provides this)
6. **Wide-angle lens**: Some phones capture wide FOV, reducing text pixel density
7. **iOS zoom**: No zoom control available on iOS Safari

## Development Guidelines

### No Defensive Coding for Dependencies

This project enforces a **fail-loudly** philosophy for dependencies. We DO NOT use defensive coding patterns like:

```javascript
// ❌ BAD - Silent fallbacks
try {
    const psl = require('psl');
} catch (e) {
    console.warn('psl not available, using fallback');
}

// ❌ BAD - typeof checks
if (typeof require !== 'undefined') {
    const psl = require('psl');
}

// ❌ BAD - || fallbacks
const psl = window.psl || require('psl');
```

Instead, dependencies MUST be available or the app fails:

```javascript
// ✅ GOOD - Fail loudly if psl not available
const psl = (typeof window !== 'undefined' && window.psl) || require('psl');
```

**Why:**
- Silent failures in production are worse than loud failures in development
- Missing dependencies should be caught during build/test, not in production
- Defensive fallbacks hide configuration problems

**How we enforce this:**
- ESLint rules (`eslint.config.js`) forbid defensive patterns
- Run `npm run lint` to check for violations
- CI should fail if linting fails

**How we handle browser vs Node.js:**
- Browser: Load from CDN (see `<script>` tags in `index.html`)
- Node.js tests: `npm install` provides dependencies
- Both environments get the same code - no fallbacks


## Trust Model

The app verifies:
1. ✅ Computed hash matches the hash in the URL
2. ✅ URL endpoint exists (HTTP 200)
3. ✅ Endpoint confirms validity (body contains "OK")

**Trust assumption:** The domain owner (e.g., `intertek.com`) won't host fake verification endpoints.

**Attack resistance:**
- Can't forge a URL with correct hash without the original text
- Can't alter text without changing the hash
- Can't use someone else's hash because OCR'd URL won't match
