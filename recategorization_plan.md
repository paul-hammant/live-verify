## Questions to Help Finalize

1. **Gaming & Gambling (1 item: lottery payouts)** — Should this merge with "Sports & Athletics" or stay separate?
2. **Chain of Custody** — Should this be its own category, or merge into "Shipping & Freight"?
3. **Energy & Utilities** — Standalone or part of a broader "Infrastructure & Utilities" category?
4. **Intellectual Property Law** — Keep separate (3 items) or merge into legal documents?
