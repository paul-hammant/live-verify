## Claimed degrees and certs on CV/Resume

Employment and education verification on a CV/resume are an ideal use case for OCR-to-hash. Here's why:

Key criteria: Personal claim with an expectation of privacy in the public record. Each is one-off. A need to be cheaply verifiable for decades.

**What would be on the CV:**

```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│                                 │
│  Edinburgh University           │
│  Bachelor of Computer Science   │
│  First Class Honours            │
│  Awarded: July 2020             │
│  To: Tim Berners-Lee, Junior    │
│  verify:degrees.ed.ac.uk        │
│                                 │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

The **hash is NOT printed** on the CV. It's a function of all the other text so it would be impossible to do so. Only the base URL appears.  As it happens the above fits a templater that mal-intending groups could brute-force "Tim Berners-Lee Junior" is replaceable for other names toward a SHA-256 calc and a HTTP-GET on degrees.ed.ac.uk. Someone could quickly write Python to test thousands a second (notwithstanding rate limits).  If these facts were valuable enough a reference number would be inserted too, or maybe random chars that are OCR-able (for something that's way more valuable than "I've a degree").

**Interview workflow:**

1. Interviewer has printed CV in hand
2. Opens phone app, scans the registration-marked section (see [Technical_Concepts.md: Registration Marks](Technical_Concepts.md#registration-marks))
3. App OCRs text, normalizes it (see [Technical_Concepts.md: Text Normalization](Technical_Concepts.md#text-normalization)), computes hash from the certification text
4. App builds full URL: `https://degrees.ed.ac.uk/{computed_hash}` using SHA-256 (see [Technical_Concepts.md: Hash Algorithms](Technical_Concepts.md#hash-algorithms))
5. Fetches URL taking advantage of the setup of degrees.ed.ac.uk not having or needing accounts/logins to access
6. The fetch yields a `200` http response, and the entire content could be blank or `OK` to signal verification success (see [Technical_Concepts.md: Response Formats](Technical_Concepts.md#response-formats))
7. Interviewer sees that on the phone app and pencils "✓ verified" on the CV themselves. Recruitment intermediaries may have done that too

**Why this is privacy-preserving:**

- There is nothing a search engine may hold that would direct you back to the same `OK`
- Only someone who has a printed version of the CV (or a scan/pic of it) can initiate claim verification
- No public registry of who has what degree (just verification on demand)
- GDPR compliant: interviewer has legitimate interest in verification. `ebe51417c7a506ee09763e055590858568b841f238cb6462818709cfbfebbdca` is not PII, or personal or private. Of course, a prospective employer retaining the CV itself has to be GDPR complaint if in the EU/UK.

Note ebe51417c7a506ee09763e055590858568b841f238cb6462818709cfbfebbdca is the SHA-256 of `Edinburgh ... Junior` above.

## Why QR Codes FAIL for CV/Resume Credentials

### 1. Visual Clutter on Professional Documents

**Problem with QR codes:**
- A CV with 5-10 verifiable claims would need **5-10 QR codes**:
  - BSc Edinburgh (2016)
  - MSc Cambridge (2018)
  - Worked at Google (2018-2020)
  - Worked at Microsoft (2020-2023)
  - AWS Certified Solutions Architect
  - CFA Charter holder
- **Makes CV look amateurish** - like a flyer, not a professional document
- Interviewer can't read "Edinburgh University First Class Honours" by looking at a QR code
- Need both QR code AND text → redundant, cluttered

**OCR-to-hash solution:**
- Just one small `verify:` URL per claim
- Text IS the certification (human-readable)
- Clean, professional appearance
- Interviewer reads text first, verifies if suspicious

### 2. Privacy Exposure

**Problem with QR codes:**
- QR must encode either:
  - **(A) Direct link:** `https://degrees.ed.ac.uk/verify?student_id=12345&degree=BSc`
    - Anyone can iterate: `student_id=12344`, `12345`, `12346`...
    - Scraper downloads entire university's graduate database
    - Public enumeration of "who graduated where"
  - **(B) Full claim with signature:** QR encodes all text + digital signature
    - Larger QR code (more pixels needed)
    - Still scrapeable from public photos of CVs
    - Privacy violation (graduation records become public)

**OCR-to-hash solution:**
- Hash not printed (only base URL)
- No enumeration vector (can't scrape all graduates)
- Only someone with physical CV can compute hash
- Privacy-preserving (no public registry)

### 3. Professional Context: Multiple Claims

**Problem with QR codes:**
- Each credential needs separate QR code
- 5 degrees/certs = 5 QR codes cluttering one page
- Interviewer must scan each QR separately
- Hard to distinguish which QR verifies which claim

**OCR-to-hash solution:**
- Each claim is self-contained text block
- Interviewer reads claim, then optionally verifies
- Verification is secondary (readability primary)
- Clean layout (no visual QR grid)

### 4. Domain Spoofing Risk

**Problem with QR codes:**
- Fake degree prints QR pointing to `https://edinburgh-university.com/verify` (lookalike domain)
- Interviewer scans QR, sees "Degree Verified" on attacker's server
- Hard to spot domain spoofing in quick interaction
- No cryptographic binding between printed university name and QR URL

**OCR-to-hash solution:**
- Text determines domain ("Edinburgh University" → `degrees.ed.ac.uk`)
- App displays: **"VERIFIED by degrees.ed.ac.uk"** (not fake domain)
- Domain binding (see [Technical_Concepts.md: Domain Binding](Technical_Concepts.md#domain-binding))
- Interviewer sees immediately which authority verified

## This Privacy-Preserving Pattern Applies To

**Claimed Credentials:**
- Academic degrees (bachelor's, master's, doctorate)
- Professional certifications (AWS, CPA, CFA, etc.)
- Training completions
- Language proficiency certificates (TOEFL, IELTS)

**Claimed Work History:**
- Employment verification letters
- Volunteer work verification

All share the key criteria: personal claims with privacy expectations, one-off documents, need for long-term verifiability (decades), and hash-not-printed verification.

**Note on ornate degree certificates:** Traditional university diplomas with decorative fonts, seals, and embossing are difficult for current OCR technology to read. See [Multi_Representation_Verification.md](../Multi_Representation_Verification.md) for how universities can support ornate wall certificates AND plain-text CV claims AND LinkedIn profiles - unlimited representations of the same degree.

---

## Pricing Model: Who Pays for Verification?

**Core principle:** Universities were already paid (via tuition or taxes) to educate students and issue degrees. Verification is part of that mission, not a new revenue stream. See [Verification_Charges.md](Verification_Charges.md) for detailed ethical framework.

### Infrastructure Costs

**Marginal cost per verification:** ~$0.000005 (half a cent per thousand verifications)

**Example using Cloudflare Workers:**
- 10 million requests/month: $5
- 100 million requests/month: $50
- Hash lookup: Simple database query (DynamoDB, PostgreSQL)
- Total cost: Negligible compared to university IT budgets

**For context:** Universities already spend millions on IT infrastructure (student portals, email, learning management systems). Adding degree verification is a rounding error.

### Tier 1: Universities (Issuers)

**Cost to university:** Near-zero infrastructure cost (static hosting + serverless API)

**Why free verification makes sense:**
- **Mission-aligned:** Helping graduates prove credentials supports educational mission
- **Already compensated:** Tuition/taxes funded the degree issuance
- **Reputation benefit:** Verified graduates reflect well on university
- **Anti-fraud:** Reduces diploma mills and fake degrees (protects university brand)

**Implementation options:**
1. **Self-hosted:** University hosts `https://degrees.university.edu/c/{hash}` endpoint
2. **Shared infrastructure:** Consortium of universities shares verification platform (cost-split)
3. **National system:** Government-funded verification for public universities (UK, EU model)

### Tier 2: Job Seekers & Graduates (Individuals)

**Cost to graduate:** FREE

**Why graduates don't pay:**
- Already paid tuition for the degree
- Verification benefits employers (fraud prevention), not just graduates
- Charging graduates creates friction (reduces adoption)
- Public interest in accurate credentials (prevents fraud in hiring, admissions)

**Usage pattern:**
- Graduate includes verifiable claim on CV (one-time setup)
- Employers verify as needed (no action required from graduate)
- Unlimited verifications (graduate doesn't control or pay per verification)

### Tier 3: Employers & Recruitment Agencies (Verifiers)

**Free tier (small employers, individual hiring managers):**
- **Cost:** FREE for 1-100 verifications/year
- **Use case:** Small businesses, individual verifications, peace-of-mind checks
- **Access:** Web app (scan CV, get instant verification)

**Paid tier (high-volume commercial users):**
- **Cost:** $100-$500/month for unlimited verifications
- **Use case:** Recruitment agencies, HR departments at large corporations, background check companies
- **Features:**
  - API access for bulk verification
  - Integration with applicant tracking systems (ATS)
  - SLA guarantees (99.9% uptime)
  - Audit trail for compliance (GDPR, FCRA)
  - Priority support

**Why charge high-volume verifiers:**
- They derive commercial value (reduce hiring risk, speed up recruitment)
- Legal liability protection worth far more than $0.50/verification
- Cost per verification (~$0.10 in paid tier) far lower than phone-based verification (30 minutes of HR time = $15-30)
- Freemium model subsidizes individual/small business use

### Tier 4: Background Check Companies

**Annual enterprise license:** $2,000-$5,000/year
- Bulk verification API (millions of checks/year)
- Integration with existing background check platforms
- Audit trail for compliance (Fair Credit Reporting Act in US)
- Educational credentials bundled with employment history, criminal records

**Cost justification:**
- Background checks cost $30-100 per candidate
- Education verification currently requires manual calls to universities (slow, expensive)
- Instant cryptographic verification reduces turnaround time from days to seconds
- Improves accuracy (eliminates transcription errors from phone calls)

### Cost Comparison: OCR-to-Hash vs Traditional Methods

| Verification Method | Time | Cost | Accuracy |
|---------------------|------|------|----------|
| **Phone call to university** | 30-60 min | $15-30 (HR time) | 85% (transcription errors) |
| **Email to registrar** | 3-7 days | $10-20 (back-and-forth) | 90% |
| **Third-party service (Clearinghouse)** | 1-3 days | $10-25 per verification | 95% |
| **OCR-to-hash (this system)** | 10-15 sec | $0.10 (paid tier) / FREE (free tier) | 99%+ (cryptographic) |

**Employer perspective:**
- Hiring a software engineer at $100K salary
- Risk of fake degree: Costly termination, wasted training, potential legal liability
- Cost to verify: $0 (free tier) or $0.10 (paid tier)
- **ROI is obvious** - near-zero cost for significant risk reduction

### Revenue Model for Universities

**Option A: Verification stays free forever**
- Universities absorb ~$100-500/month infrastructure cost
- Funded by existing IT budgets
- Treated as public service (like hosting course catalogs, faculty directories)

**Option B: University charges high-volume commercial users**
- Free for individuals and small employers (1-100 verifications/year)
- Paid tier for recruitment agencies and background check companies
- Revenue offsets infrastructure costs (break-even, not profit center)
- Example: 1 million paid verifications/year at $0.10 each = $100K revenue (covers hosting + staff time)

**Option C: Consortium model**
- Group of universities (e.g., Ivy League, Russell Group, UC system) shares verification infrastructure
- Cost-split across members (~$10-50K/year per university)
- Shared platform reduces individual infrastructure burden
- Unified API for employers (verify degrees from any member university)

**Most likely outcome:** Mix of all three - some universities keep it free (public mission), others charge high-volume users (cost recovery), some join consortiums (efficiency).

### Real-World Adoption Example: National Student Clearinghouse (US)

**Context:** Existing service for US degree verification
- 3,600+ participating institutions
- 98% of US students covered
- Employers pay $8-12 per verification
- Students/universities provide data for free

**OCR-to-hash advantages over Clearinghouse model:**
1. **Privacy-preserving:** No central database of who has what degree (Clearinghouse stores all records)
2. **Lower cost:** $0.10 vs $8-12 per verification (100x cheaper)
3. **Instant:** 10 seconds vs 1-3 days turnaround
4. **Cryptographic proof:** Cannot be faked (Clearinghouse relies on institutional data uploads)
5. **Graduate control:** Hash on CV gives graduate agency (Clearinghouse requires employer-initiated request)

**Clearinghouse could adopt OCR-to-hash:**
- Universities generate hashes when issuing degrees
- Clearinghouse hosts verification endpoints (infrastructure already exists)
- Pricing drops from $8 to $0.10-0.50 (marginal cost decreases)
- Privacy improves (no central database needed, just hash lookups)

4. **Liability protection** - Cryptographic proof of due diligence
5. **Accuracy** - 99%+ vs 85-95% with manual verification

### Technical Implementation Path

**Step 1: University generates hashes during graduation**
```python
# When degree is conferred
graduate_name = "Jane Elizabeth Smith"
degree = "Bachelor of Science (First Class Honours)"
field = "Computer Science"
date = "2023-06-23"
institution = "University of Edinburgh"

# Construct normalized text (see NORMALIZATION.md)
text = f"{institution}\n{degree}\n{field}\nAwarded to: {graduate_name}\nDate: {date}"

# Compute SHA-256 hash
hash_long_form = sha256(text.encode('utf-8')).hexdigest()

# Also generate short-form hash for CV use
short_text = f"BSc Computer Science (First Class)\nUniversity of Edinburgh, 2023\n{graduate_name}"
hash_short_form = sha256(short_text.encode('utf-8')).hexdigest()

# Store both hashes in database
db.store({
    'hashes': [hash_long_form, hash_short_form],
    'graduate_id': graduate.id,
    'degree': degree,
    'field': field,
    'honours': 'First Class',
    'date': date,
    'status': 'OK'
})
```

**Step 2: University hosts verification endpoint**
```javascript
// Cloudflare Worker example
addEventListener('fetch', event => {
  event.respondWith(handleRequest(event.request))
})

async function handleRequest(request) {
  const url = new URL(request.url)
  const hash = url.pathname.split('/').pop() // Extract hash from /c/{hash}

  // Lookup hash in KV store (Cloudflare KV, DynamoDB, PostgreSQL)
  const record = await DEGREE_HASHES.get(hash)

  if (!record) {
    return new Response('Not Found', { status: 404 })
  }

  const data = JSON.parse(record)

  // Simple response
  return new Response('OK', {
    status: 200,
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' }
  })

  // Or JSON response with metadata
  return new Response(JSON.stringify({
    status: 'OK',
    issuer: 'University of Edinburgh',
    degree: data.degree,
    field: data.field,
    honours: data.honours,
    date: data.date
  }), {
    status: 200,
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' }
  })
}
```

**Step 3: Graduate generates CV claim via alumni portal**
```
https://alumni.ed.ac.uk/verify-credentials
  → Login with university credentials
  → Select degree: "BSc Computer Science, 2023"
  → Portal displays short-form text:
     ┌────────────────────────────────────────┐
     │ BSc Computer Science (First Class)    │
     │ University of Edinburgh, 2023          │
     │ Jane Elizabeth Smith                   │
     │                                        │
     │ verify:degrees.ed.ac.uk/c              │
     └────────────────────────────────────────┘
  → Graduate copies to CV (plain text, no hash printed)
```

**Step 4: Employer verifies using mobile app**
- Scan CV claim with phone camera
- App OCRs text, normalizes, computes hash
- App fetches `https://degrees.ed.ac.uk/c/{hash}`
- Displays: ✅ **VERIFIED by degrees.ed.ac.uk**

### Backwards Compatibility

**Old degrees without verification:**
- Issued before OCR-to-hash adoption (pre-2025)
- Universities can retroactively generate hashes for alumni (Phase 2)
- Alumni portal allows graduates of any year to request hash generation
- Phone/email verification remains fallback for non-participating universities

**Transition period (10-20 years):**
- Some CVs have verifiable claims, others don't
- Employers treat unverified claims with more scrutiny (but still accept them)
- Graduates with verified claims have competitive advantage
- Diploma mills face increasing pressure (verified credentials become norm)

**Long-term (20+ years):**
- Verifiable credentials expected on CVs (like LinkedIn profiles today)
- Unverified claims raise red flags (why isn't it verified?)
- Universities that don't support verification lose credibility
- Diploma mills effectively extinct (no employer accepts unverified claims)

### Integration with Existing Systems

**Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS):**
- Workday, Greenhouse, Lever, Taleo add OCR-to-hash verification
- One-click "Verify Degrees" button in candidate profiles
- Auto-flags fake degrees in applicant pool
- Audit trail for compliance (EEOC, GDPR)

**LinkedIn:**
- "Verify Degree" button on profile education section
- Upload short-form claim text or scan with camera
- LinkedIn verifies via API, adds ✅ badge to profile
- Increases profile visibility in recruiter searches

**Background Check Services:**
- Sterling, HireRight, Checkr integrate OCR-to-hash
- Instant degree verification bundled with criminal checks, employment history
- Reduces turnaround time from 3-5 days to 1-2 days
- Lowers cost (eliminates manual university calls)

**University Systems:**
- Student Information Systems (SIS) auto-generate hashes at graduation
- Registrar portals allow staff to generate hashes for alumni requests
- Integration with transcript printing (short-form claim printed on official transcripts)
- API for bulk hash generation (retroactive alumni hashing)

### Fraud Deterrence Impact

**Diploma mills today:**
- Sell fake degrees for $500-5,000
- Rely on employers not verifying (phone verification is slow, expensive)
- Operate in gray areas (fake accreditation, offshore domains)

**With OCR-to-hash adoption:**
- Fake degrees fail instant verification (❌ **FAILS VERIFICATION**)
- Employers can verify in 10 seconds (no excuse not to check)
- Diploma mills must spoof legitimate university domains (harder, illegal)
- Domain binding prevents spoofing (can't print "MIT" and verify against fake domain)

**Real-world example: Axact scandal (Pakistan, 2015)**
- Company sold 215,000+ fake degrees from fake universities
- US clients paid $50M+ for unaccredited credentials
- Took years to uncover (slow manual verification)
- With OCR-to-hash: Would be detected in seconds (domains not from real universities)

### Privacy & GDPR Compliance

**GDPR considerations (EU/UK):**
- Hash is not personal data (cannot reconstruct name/degree from hash)
- Verification on legitimate interest basis (employer has right to verify)
- No data transfer to third parties (just hash lookup on university server)
- Graduate controls claim inclusion on CV (opt-in, not forced)

**Right to be forgotten:**
- Graduate can request university remove hash from database
- Future verifications fail (404 Not Found)
- But: University may have legal obligation to maintain graduation records
- Practical outcome: Hashes stay valid (graduate simply omits from CV if desired)

**Data minimization:**
- No central database needed (each university hosts own hashes)
- Verifier only learns "degree is valid" (not full transcript)
- No tracking of who verified what (stateless hash lookups)

## Who Benefits and How

### Universities & Registrars

**Benefits:**
1. **Fraud deterrence** - Reduces fake degrees bearing university name (protects reputation)
2. **Reduced administrative burden** - Fewer phone/email verification requests (100+ hours/year saved)
3. **Alumni career support** - Helps graduates prove credentials (extends university mission)
4. **Competitive advantage** - Early adopters signal tech-forward, anti-fraud stance
5. **Near-zero cost** - $100-500/month infrastructure (rounding error compared to existing IT spend)

**Workflow improvement:**
- **Before:** Registrar receives 50-200 verification calls/month, each taking 10-15 minutes
- **After:** Automated hash verification, registrar only handles edge cases (disputed claims, special circumstances)
- **Time saved:** 10-30 hours/month (allows registrar to focus on student services)

**Real-world example:**
- Large state university with 50,000 graduates
- Receives 2,000 verification requests/year
- Current cost: 500 staff hours/year at $30/hour = $15,000/year
- OCR-to-hash infrastructure: $3,000/year (serverless hosting)
- **Net savings: $12,000/year** while improving verification speed and accuracy

### Job Seekers & Graduates

**Benefits:**
1. **Competitive advantage** - Stand out with instantly verifiable credentials
2. **Convenience** - No more uploading transcripts, waiting days for verification
3. **Privacy** - No central credential database (graduate controls what goes on CV)
4. **Portability** - Verified claim travels with CV forever (decades of validity)
5. **Control** - Graduate decides which degrees to highlight, which to omit

**User experience:**
- **Traditional:** Apply for job → upload transcript → wait 3-7 days for background check → hope for call back
- **OCR-to-hash:** Include verifiable claim on CV → employer verifies in 10 seconds during initial screening → faster callback

**Career impact:**
- **International graduates:** Proving foreign degrees to US/UK employers is notoriously slow (weeks). Instant verification removes friction.
- **Career changers:** Verifying 10-year-old degree from closed university department? Hash remains valid even if department shuttered.
- **Multiple credentials:** MBA + BSc + CPA? Each credential verifiable independently, no bundled transcript needed.

### Employers & HR Departments

**Benefits:**
1. **Risk reduction** - Instant fraud detection (fake degrees caught in 10 seconds)
2. **Cost savings** - $0-0.10 per verification vs $8-30 for phone/background check service
3. **Speed** - 10 seconds vs 1-7 days turnaround (faster hiring decisions)
4. **Liability protection** - Cryptographic proof of due diligence (audit trail)
5. **Accuracy** - 99%+ verification rate vs 85-95% with manual methods (eliminates transcription errors)

**Hiring workflow improvement:**
- **Resume screening phase:** HR manager scans degrees during initial review (10 sec/candidate)
- **Interview phase:** Interviewer confirms credentials before extending offer
- **Background check phase:** Already verified, background check company just re-confirms hash
- **Result:** Days shaved off hiring timeline, reduced risk of bad hires

**ROI calculation (100-person company hiring 20 people/year):**
- **Traditional verification:** 20 checks × $15 (phone time) = $300/year
- **OCR-to-hash (paid tier):** $300/year unlimited verifications
- **Savings:** $0/year but **massive risk reduction** (prevents 1 bad hire = $50K+ in wasted training/severance)

**Large enterprise (10,000 employees, 500 hires/year):**
- **Traditional:** 500 × $25 (background check service) = $12,500/year
- **OCR-to-hash:** $3,000/year (enterprise license) = **$9,500/year savings**
- Plus: Faster hiring (competitive advantage in tight labor markets)

### Recruitment Agencies & Headhunters

**Benefits:**
1. **Faster candidate screening** - Verify credentials during intake call (builds trust)
2. **Reduced liability** - Cryptographic proof of credential verification (protects reputation)
3. **Competitive advantage** - "All our candidates have verified credentials" (marketing differentiator)
4. **Lower costs** - Bulk verification cheaper than phone calls or third-party services
5. **Better candidate experience** - No asking candidates to upload transcripts (friction reduction)

**Business model impact:**
- Recruitment agencies charge 15-25% of first-year salary (e.g., $20K fee for $100K hire)
- Risk: Fake degree discovered after placement → client demands fee refund, agency reputation damaged
- OCR-to-hash: Instant verification during candidate vetting → near-zero risk of credential fraud
- **Value:** Protecting one $20K placement fee pays for 5+ years of verification service

### Background Check Companies

**Benefits:**
1. **Faster turnaround** - Reduce 3-5 day checks to 1-2 days (competitive advantage)
2. **Lower costs** - Eliminate manual university calls (staff time saved)
3. **Higher accuracy** - Cryptographic verification vs manual transcription
4. **Scalability** - API integration handles 10x volume with no staff increase
5. **Upsell opportunity** - Instant verification as premium service add-on

**Integration value:**
- Background checks bundle: Criminal history + employment + education + credit
- Education verification currently slowest component (3-7 days)
- With OCR-to-hash: Education done instantly, only criminal/employment take time
- **Result:** Faster overall turnaround, happier customers, ability to take on more volume

**Competitive positioning:**
- Market leaders (Sterling, HireRight) charge $30-100 per background check
- Education verification is $8-12 of that cost
- Early adopter of OCR-to-hash can drop price to $25-80 (cost advantage) or keep price same (margin expansion)

### Educational Credentialing Bodies

**Who:** Accreditation agencies (ABET, AACSB), professional licensure boards (state bar associations, medical boards), certification bodies (CPA, CFA, PMP)

**Benefits:**
1. **Standard verification protocol** - All members adopt same hash system (network effects)
2. **Fraud deterrence** - Unaccredited programs can't issue verifiable credentials
3. **Quality signal** - Accredited programs offer verifiable degrees (differentiation from diploma mills)
4. **Reduced accreditation disputes** - Instant verification of whether program is accredited
5. **Public trust** - Transparency about which programs are legitimate

**Example: ABET (engineering accreditation):**
- 4,000+ accredited programs worldwide
- Graduates from ABET programs can include verifiable claims on CVs
- Non-ABET programs cannot (claims fail verification or omit verification URL)
- **Result:** ABET accreditation becomes more visible, valuable to students

### Students (Prospective)

**Benefits:**
1. **Fraud avoidance** - Can verify instructor credentials before enrolling (professor has real PhD?)
2. **University legitimacy** - Check if university supports credential verification (diploma mill red flag)
3. **Transfer credit confidence** - Verify that previous university is legitimate (credits will transfer)
4. **Career planning** - Understand verification will help in job search (ROI of degree)

**Decision-making impact:**
- Student choosing between University A (verified credentials) vs University B (no verification)
- University A signals: Legitimate, tech-forward, cares about graduate career outcomes
- University B signals: Potentially unaccredited, or simply behind the times
- **Choice:** Student chooses University A (all else equal)

### Government & Public Interest

**Benefits:**
1. **Labor market efficiency** - Faster, more accurate hiring (productivity gains)
2. **Fraud deterrence** - Diploma mills face extinction (public protection)
3. **Educational quality** - Transparent credential verification (accountability)
4. **Reduced inequality** - Free verification removes economic barriers (anyone can prove credentials)
5. **Tax efficiency** - Public universities reduce administrative costs (taxpayer savings)

**Public policy implications:**
- Government licensing (teachers, engineers, lawyers) requires degree verification
- Current system: Slow, manual, expensive phone calls to universities
- OCR-to-hash: Instant verification at near-zero cost
- **Result:** Faster licensure, lower administrative burden, more people able to work in licensed professions

**Example: Teacher certification (US):**
- 50 states each maintain separate teacher licensure systems
- Each requires degree verification from accredited programs
- Current cost: $10-25 per verification × 200,000 new teachers/year = $2-5M/year
- OCR-to-hash: Near-zero marginal cost (states host verification endpoints)
- **Savings:** $2-5M/year redirected to education programs

### International Credential Recognition

**Who:** International students, immigrants, visa applicants, foreign credential evaluation services

**Benefits:**
1. **Border crossing** - Degrees verify even if original country's systems are offline
2. **Language independence** - Hash works regardless of language on original document
3. **No apostille needed** - Cryptographic verification replaces notarization/apostille
4. **Decades of validity** - Hash remains valid even if issuing institution closes
5. **Reduced fraud** - Common in international credential verification (fake degrees from overseas universities)

**Real-world scenario:**
- Indian graduate with BTech from IIT applies for US job
- Traditional: Upload transcript → wait for evaluation service (Educational Credential Evaluators) → 4-6 weeks, $200 fee
- OCR-to-hash: Include verifiable claim on CV → US employer verifies in 10 seconds via IIT's endpoint
- **Result:** Weeks saved, $200 saved, immediate trust established

**Refugee/asylum seekers:**
- Lost original degree documents fleeing war zone
- University in home country may be destroyed or inaccessible
- If hash was generated before fleeing, credential remains verifiable forever
- **Impact:** Ability to rebuild career in new country without waiting years for replacement documents
